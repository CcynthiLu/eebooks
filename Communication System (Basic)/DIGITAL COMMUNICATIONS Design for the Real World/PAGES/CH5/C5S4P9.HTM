<h2>Phase ambiguity in PSK carrier recovery</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The 'squarer'-based form of carrier recovery looks ideal, but
    unfortunately it suffers from one significant drawback &#150; the process of halving the
    frequency of the twice carrier term introduces a 180<sup>o</sup> <font color="#0080FF">phase
    ambiguity</font> into the carrier reference. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Consider the case of a 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;... 
    filtered data stream entering the
    squaring circuit. The output will be a twice carrier term, with zero-crossings at twice
    the rate of the input. Feeding this signal to a 'divide by two' circuit, it is clear that
    the divider logic can be triggered by either of the zero-crossings in the twice carrier
    waveform, and can have no knowledge of which one relates to the correct zero crossing (and
    hence phase) of the input. The result is that the recovered carrier may be coherent with 0<sup>o</sup>
    phase error, or it may be inverted with 180<sup>o</sup> phase error. Feeding the inverted
    reference to the coherent detector will result in all of the detected data being inverted!<br>
    <br>
    This problem can be resolved by sending a <font color="#0080FF">training sequence</font>
    known to the receiver from which it can deduce that data inversion has occurred and
    correct accordingly. The training sequence approach does not work well, however, if the
    channel is frequently interrupted (for example, in a <a href="../ch4/c4s5p2.htm">fading
    mobile environment</a>), resulting in periodic loss of carrier reference. Each time the
    carrier reference is re-established, an unknown phase ambiguity will again be present,
    requiring a repeated retransmission of the training sequence. This phase ambiguity problem
    is also present within the <a "" href="c5s4p8.htm">Costas loop</a> even though it does not
    have an implicit divider circuit. </td>
