<h2>Coherent FSK detection</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Coherent detection of FSK is very similar to that for ASK but in this case
    there are two detectors tuned to the two carrier frequencies. As for ASK, coherent
    detection and matched filtering minimize the effects of noise in the receiver. <br>
    <br>
    Recovery of the carrier references in the coherent receiver is made simple if the
    frequency spacing between the symbols is made equal to the symbol rate (<a href="c5s3p5.htm">Sunde's FSK</a>), as the modulated spectrum contains discrete spectral
    lines at the carrier frequencies. The drawback of using Sunde's FSK is that the bandwidth
    of the FSK signal is approximately 1.5 to 2 times that of an optimally filtered ASK or PSK
    binary signal. </td>
