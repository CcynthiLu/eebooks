<h2>Relative BER performance</h2>

<h3>Equal <i>peak</i> symbol energy</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The bit error performance for the major binary modulation schemes,
    assuming equal <font color="#0080FF">peak symbol power</font>, is shown here. This
    introduces a 3&nbsp;dB degradation into the performance curves for ASK. <br>
    <br>
    There are many applications where the available power is peak limited, possibly by the
    power source itself, or by system components &#150; for example, the RF amplifier rating. Other
    systems, however, are governed by average power, such as average battery drain, or average
    heat dissipation, and the former set of curves apply.<br>
    <br>
    Although not shown here, the performance of filtered ASK and PSK systems will degrade from
    the results given owing to the increase in peak to mean power ratio caused by the
    pulse overshoot at the output of a practical pulse-shaping filter. </td>
