<h1>5.5 Comparison of binary modulation schemes </h1>
<!--Body Text Here-->

<h2>Relative BER performance</h2>

<h3>Equal <i>average</i> symbol energy</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The bit error performance for the major binary modulation schemes is shown
    here, with the PSK family demonstrating optimum performance as would be expected with <font color="#0080FF">antipodal</font>
    signalling. Coherent FSK with <a "" href="../ch6/c6s3p2.htm">orthogonal signalling</a> is
    the next best together with coherent ASK, assuming comparison on an <font color="#0080FF">average
    symbol</font> power basis. All of these binary systems exhibit a theoretical maximum
    bandwidth efficiency of 1&nbsp;bit/second/Hz. <br>
    <br>
    It is interesting to compare these results with the theoretical minimum <I>E<sub>s</sub></i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub> 
    of only 1 (or 0&nbsp;dB) required for error-free transmission and 1 bit/s/Hz capacity as given by the 
    <a "" href="../ch2/c2s4p6.htm">Shannon&#150;Hartley capacity theorem</a>. This clearly
    demonstrates that implicit within the Shannon&#150;Hartley prediction is significant
    performance improvement over the basic modem design achieved using message data coding
    techniques. Consequently, <a "" href="../ch7/c7s1p1.htm">Chapter 7</a> is given over to
    the discussion of coding for improved digital communications performance. </td>
