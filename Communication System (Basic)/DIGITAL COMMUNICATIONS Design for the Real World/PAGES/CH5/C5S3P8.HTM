<h2>Non-coherent PLL-based FSK detection</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The <font color="#0080FF">phase-locked loop (PLL)</font>, is frequently
    used in symbol and carrier recovery circuits for digital communications systems. The basic
    operation of the PLL is described here in connection with its use as an FSK detector. For
    a more detailed discussion of PLL systems there is an excellent book by <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Gardner">Gardner (1966)</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The PLL consists of three building blocks: a <font color="#0080FF">voltage controlled
    oscillator</font> whose output frequency is proportional to the input voltage, a <font color="#0080FF">phase detector</font> (often implemented using a multiplier or
    exclusive-or gate) which produces a voltage output proportional to the phase difference
    between the two inputs, and a <font color="#0080FF">loop filter</font> which is used to
    control the dynamics of the <font color="#0080FF">feedback</font> circuit.</td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="ch5figs/sec3/pll_dect.gif" align="right" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="171"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The PLL acts by comparing the phase of the input signal with that of the
    VCO and using the voltage generated by the phase difference to alter the frequency and
    phase of the VCO to <font color="#0080FF">match</font> that of the input. The system
    reaches a stable steady state when the average output from the phase detector is zero,
    implying that the VCO is <font color="#0080FF">phase-locked</font> to the input signal.
    (With mixer-based phase detectors, there is a 90<sup>o</sup> phase difference between
    input and VCO in the phase-locked state.) Because the VCO control voltage must change in
    order for the PLL to track and lock onto a new input frequency, it provides a direct
    measure of the input signal frequency for each symbol in the FSK stream and hence acts as
    a first-class detector. </td>
