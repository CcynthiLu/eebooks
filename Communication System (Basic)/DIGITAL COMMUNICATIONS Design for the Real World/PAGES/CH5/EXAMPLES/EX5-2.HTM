<h2>Example 5.2</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A coherent ASK demodulator has a 5<sup>o</sup> error in its locally 
generated carrier reference. What will be the degradation in noise power immunity compared 
with an ideal demodulator?</h4>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The voltage output of the mixer used to compare the incoming symbol 
<i>a</i>(<i>t</i>)&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>
with the reference 
cos(<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5<sup>o</sup>) 
will be reduced by a factor cos(5<sup>o</sup>) from its maximum value as
a result of the carrier phase error.</font></small></small></p>

<h4 CLASS="technical">This in turn equates to a reduction in symbol energy
at the input to the receiver of cos<sup>2</sup>(5<sup>o</sup>). (Symbol energy is proportional to
power x symbol length or voltage<sup>2</sup> x symbol length.)</h4>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The noise components passing through the mixer will
also be affected by the phase error in the carrier reference, but since the noise vectors
are assumed to be randomly distributed through 360<sup>o</sup>, the carrier phase error
will reduce the effect of some noise vectors and enhance others with the net effect that
the <font color="#0080FF">average noise voltage</font> at the mixer output will remain unchanged. </h4>
<h4 class="technical">Hence it is only the symbol energy that is truly affected by carrier reference phase error and not the noise
power. This means that the effective received symbol energy
to noise power density will be reduced by a factor 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;cos<sup>2</sup>(5<sup>o</sup>)
=&nbsp;1.0076, or 0.0033&nbsp;dB as a result of the phase error.</h4>
