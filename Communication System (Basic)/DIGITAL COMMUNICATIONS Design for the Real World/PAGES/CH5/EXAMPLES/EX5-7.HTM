<h2>Example 5.7</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A binary PSK modem uses a preamble data word to
achieve symbol synchronization in the receiver. This symbol timing reference, however,
drifts between resynchronization bursts so that the timing is in error by 10% when the
next synchronisation update is received. If the PSK detector uses an integrate and dump
filter, and the symbols are not shaped, what will be the worst-case degradation on the
effective received symbol energy due to the timing error?</h4>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<h4 CLASS="technical">With reference to the diagram below, the 10% timing
error in the symbol sampling time will result in the voltage at the output from the
integrator when sampled being reduced by 90% of the optimum value. This in turn will
result in a fall of 81% (0.9&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.9) in the effective symbol energy, equivalent to a 
0.91&nbsp;dB degradation in <I>E<sub>b</sub></i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub> performance for the modem.</h4>
