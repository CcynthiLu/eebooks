<h2>Example 5.5</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A coherent PSK demodulator uses a carrier recovery
circuit which introduces a time delay in the recovered reference equal to 7% of the
carrier period. What will be the degradation in noise power immunity for this system
compared with an ideal demodulator?</h4>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A time delay of 7% of the carrier period results in
a phase error in the recovered carrier of 7% or 360<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.2<sup>o</sup>.<BR><BR>

The <font color="#0080FF">voltage</font> output of the mixer used to compare the
incoming symbol <i>a</i>(<i>t</i>)&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>
with the reference cos(<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;25.2<sup>o</sup>)
will be reduced by a factor cos(25.2<sup>o</sup>) from its maximum
value as a result of the carrier phase error.<br><BR>

This in turn equates to a reduction in symbol energy
at the input to the receiver of cos<sup>2</sup>(25.2<sup>o</sup>). (Symbol energy is
proportional to power x symbol length or voltage<sup>2</sup> x symbol length.)</font></small></small></p>

<p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The noise components passing through the mixer will
also be affected by the phase error in the carrier reference, but since the noise vectors
are assumed to be randomly distributed through 360<sup>o</sup>, the carrier phase error
will reduce the effect of some noise vectors and enhance others with the net effect that
the average noise voltage at the mixer output will remain unchanged. Hence it is only the
symbol energy that is truly affected by carrier reference phase error and not the noise
power. This means that the effective received symbol energy to noise power density will be
reduced by a factor 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;cos<sup>2</sup>(25.2<sup>o</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.22, or 0.87&nbsp;dB, as a result of
the phase error.</h4>
