<h2>Example 5.4</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A digital radio system uses binary FSK for data
transmission, with the two symbol frequencies at +1200&nbsp;Hz and &#150;1200&nbsp;Hz with respect
to the channel centre. The received signal is subject to a Doppler shift of +100&nbsp;Hz due to
the receiver motion. Sketch the output of a PLL FSK detector for a 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;.... data
stream assuming there is no pulse shaping. How can the problem of Doppler shift be
overcome in a digital FSK radio system?</h4>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4 CLASS="technical">The effect of the Doppler shift on the receiver
signal is to make the symbols appear at frequencies of +1300&nbsp;Hz and &#150;1100&nbsp;Hz with
respect to the notional centre frequency of the PLL detector. The result is that the PLL
output will have a dc-bias voltage superimposed on the recovered data signal as shown
below, proportional to the Doppler offset.</font></small></small></p>

<h4 CLASS="technical">To eliminate the Doppler shift the output of the PLL
detector can be ac-coupled, however, this would also affect any low frequency content in
the data signal itself. A coding scheme such as Manchester encoding (see Section 4.4), 
could be used here to remove any low frequency content in the data signal.</h4>
