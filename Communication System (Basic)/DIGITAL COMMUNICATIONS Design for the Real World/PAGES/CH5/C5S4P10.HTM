<h2>Differential data encoding</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">An alternative and more frequently used method of coping with phase
    ambiguity in the carrier recovery process is to use <font color="#0080FF">differential
    encoding and decoding</font> of the input and received data stream. This process is termed
    <font color="#0080FF">Differentially Encoded Phase Shift Keying (DEPSK)</font>. The
    challenge is to come up with&nbsp; an encoding/decoding scheme that will give the same
    decoded output regardless of whether the received data is inverted.<br>
    <br>
    Shown here is such an encoder based on an exclusive-or gate. This circuit operates by
    translating the input data into a coded data stream where a logic 1 at the input is coded
    as a <font color="#0080FF">change of logic state</font> from the previous coded bit, and a
    logic 0 at the input as <font color="#0080FF">no change of state</font> from the previous
    coded bit. Implementation of the 1-bit delay block can be achieved very simply using a
    clocked shift register.<br>
    <br>
    This encoding process is very efficient as it does not introduce any extra data bits and
    hence does not affect the throughput of the data modem. </td>
