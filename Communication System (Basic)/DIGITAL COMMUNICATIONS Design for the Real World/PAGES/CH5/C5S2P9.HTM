<h2>Coherent detection vs non-coherent detection</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">In order to understand why coherent detection gives a better noise
    performance than non-coherent detection, it is helpful to view the <font color="#0080FF">phasor</font>
    or <font color="#0080FF">vector diagram</font> representation of ASK. A vector diagram
    maps the amplitude of a signal by the length of the line on the vector diagram, and maps
    the instantaneous phase by the angle of the line with respect to a horizontal reference
    frequency and phase (for data modulation, this reference is usually the carrier signal <font color="#0080FF">cos&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i></font>.)&nbsp; 
    Thus for ASK, we can map the two symbol
    states (carrier on or off) as two vectors on this diagram, one with length zero
    corresponding to the carrier-off state, and one with length <i>A</i> in line with the
    carrier reference, corresponding to the carrier-on state.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">We can also map noise by recognizing that a noise signal can be written
    as a vector<BR>
   <BR>
    <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>)&nbsp;cos[<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>q</SPAN>(<i>t</i>)] <BR>
   <BR>
    where <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>) is a time varying amplitude and <SPAN CLASS=greek>q</SPAN>(<i>t</i>) is a time varying phase. If we were to plot snapshots of
    the noise on the vector diagram, we would find that they were randomly distributed
    throughout all four quadrants of the vector space as shown. </td>
