<h2>Carrier recovery for ASK </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Clearly it is beneficial to use coherent detection of ASK if possible,
    but first the problem of how to derive a frequency and phase-coherent carrier reference in
    the receiver must be addressed. Obtaining sufficiently <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p9.htm">stable
    free-running oscillators</a> in both TX and RX units is not possible, and some means of
    recovering the carrier frequency and phase from the incoming data signal is needed.<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">One method that we have already encountered is to send a <a "" href="../ch4/c4s5p6.htm">reference signal</a> alongside the data signal from which the
    source carrier frequency and phase can be measured. Here we shall consider an alternative
    technique that recovers the carrier from the modulated data signal itself. By locking an
    oscillator to the phase of the incoming carrier when a carrier-on symbol is sent, and
    holding this oscillator phase when the carrier is off, it is possible to produce the
    required coherent reference. A technique that is well suited to this task is the <a "" href="c5s3p8.htm">phase-locked loop (PLL)</a>. Unfortunately the carrier reference is not
    perfect, as the carrier-on symbols are corrupted by incoming noise. However, by averaging
    the carrier over several on-symbols (equivalent to a narrow bandwidth in the PLL system),
    a cleaner reference can be obtained. </td>
