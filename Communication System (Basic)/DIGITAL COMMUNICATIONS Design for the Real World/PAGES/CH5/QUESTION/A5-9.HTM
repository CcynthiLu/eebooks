<h2>Answer 5.9</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The minimum bandwidth required to support BPSK is
twice that for a binary baseband channel which, as we saw in chapter 3, is one half of the
symbol rate. The minimum bandwidth for BPSK is thus equal to the symbol rate and the
maximum bandwidth efficiency for BPSK is thus 1&nbsp;bit/second/Hz.<BR><BR>

For a non-ideal filter, the bandwidth must be increased by a factor (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>), and
the bandwidth efficiency is thus reduced by a factor (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>). 
Thus, for an <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5, the bandwidth efficiency is reduced to 0.75&nbsp;bits/second/Hz.</h4>
