    <td width="50%"><font color="#0080FF">Differential PSK (DPSK)</font> is based on the same 'change
    of state' encoding/decoding methodology as used in <a href="c5s4p10.htm">DEPSK</a>, but
    improves upon it by incorporating the differential decoding task as part of the data
    demodulation task, and at the same time does away with the need for a 'carrier recovery'
    mechanism.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The differential encoding block and PSK modulator is common to both DPSK
    and DEPSK, but the receiver operates by comparing the phase of the current incoming
    carrier symbol with that of the previous carrier symbol. In this process, it rolls
    'coherent detection' and 'differential decoding' into one operation.<br>
    <br>
    Clearly, this detection process is much simpler than that required for true coherent PSK
    and consequently DPSK is widely used in wired and radio modems for medium-rate signalling
    (up to 4800&nbsp;bps). DPSK, however, has a slightly poorer noise immunity than PSK since the
    phase reference for DPSK is now a <font color="#0080FF">noisy delayed version</font> of the input signal rather
    than potentially a well-filtered, virtually noiseless reference from a carrier recovery
    process. </td>
