<h2>The Costas loop</h2>

<h4>A commonly used variant of the squaring-based carrier recovery method is
    the <font color="#0080FF">Costas loop</font> (<a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Costas">Costas (1956)</a>).<br>
    <br>
    The Costas loop is essentially two <a href="c5s3p8.htm">phase-locked loops</a> operating
    in parallel, with a common VCO giving quadrature outputs to each loop. The squaring
    process necessary to make the PSK modulation modulo 2<SPAN CLASS=greek>p</SPAN> is inherent within the
    Costas loop by virtue of the third mixer.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">There are two main advantages to the Costas loop. Firstly, it does not implicitly generate
    a twice carrier frequency component and thus does away with the need for a 'divide by two'
    circuit. Secondly, it performs the required coherent data detection in one of the branches
    of the dual PLL system, eliminating the need for extra detection circuitry. (A separate <a href="../ch3/c3s5p1.htm">matched filter</a> is used for data recovery as the
    filtering within the Costas loop is usually made very narrow in order to achieve good
    noise averaging of the coherent reference. </td>
