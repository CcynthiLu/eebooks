<h2>Spectrum of FSK</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The spectrum of the FSK signal is not as easy to derive as that for ASK
    because the FSK generation process is non-linear. An approximation can be obtained by
    plotting the spectra for two ASK streams centred on the respective carrier frequencies.<br>
    <br>
    Clearly, the overall bandwidth occupied by the FSK signal depends on the separation
    between the frequencies representing the symbol states. <br>
    <br>
    An FSK system using continuous phase transitions will have much lower side-lobe energy
    than the discontinuous case. </td>
