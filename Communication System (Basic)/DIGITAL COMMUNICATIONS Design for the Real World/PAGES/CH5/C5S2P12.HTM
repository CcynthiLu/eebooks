<h2>Matched filtering for ASK</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">In Chapter 3, the concept of <a "" href="../ch3/c3s5p1.htm">matched
    filtering</a> of baseband data signals for optimizing the signal to noise ratio at the
    output of a data receiver was discussed. Exactly the same approach is applicable to
    bandpass modulation detection and in fact the bandpass case reverts to the baseband case
    for ASK if <a "" href="c5s2p8.htm">coherent detection</a> is used to 'demodulate' the ASK
    signal and hence recover the source baseband data stream.<br>
    <br>
    A matched filter pair such as the <a "" href="../ch3/c3s4p4.htm">root raised cosine
    filters</a> can thus be used to shape the source and received baseband data symbols in
    ASK, and in fact this is a very common approach to achieving matched filter detection in
    most bandpass data modems. </td>
