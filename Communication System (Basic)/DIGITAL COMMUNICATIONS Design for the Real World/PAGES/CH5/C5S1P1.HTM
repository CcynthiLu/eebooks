<h1>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baseband digital modulation</h1>
<h1>5.1 Introduction to Chapter 5</h1>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The previous chapters have been largely concerned with so-called <a Href="../ch2/c2s1p1.htm">baseband signalling</a> where the channel band is assumed to
    extend from 0&nbsp;Hz upwards. In applications where contiguous bandwidth encompassing 0&nbsp;Hz is
    not available, <font color="#0080FF">bandpass signalling</font> is required. Here, the
    task is to centre the symbol energy at a given frequency of operation, for example, 900&nbsp;MHz 
    for a typical cellular telephone channel and 30000&nbsp;Hz, (1000&nbsp;nm) for an optical fibre
    link. </td>
      </tr>
</table>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">This process usually involves <font color="#0080FF">modulating </font>the
    amplitude, frequency and/or phase of a <font color="#0080FF">carrier</font> sinewave. The
    carrier is commonly written as <font color="#0080FF">cos(<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>)</font>. <br>
    <br>
    We shall see that the choice of modulation method crucially affects the ease of
    implementation, the noise tolerance and occupied channel bandwidth of the resulting
    bandpass data modem.<br>
    <br>
    Below, a chart is provided showing how the bandpass spectrum is allocated to
    different communications services based on the carrier frequency. </td>
