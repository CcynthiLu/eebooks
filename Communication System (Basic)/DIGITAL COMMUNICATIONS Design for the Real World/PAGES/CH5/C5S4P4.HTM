<h2>The effect of filtering on the PSK waveform</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">While an unfiltered PSK signal has a constant envelope, the introduction
    of filtering to constrain the modulation bandwidth reintroduces an envelope variation to
    the PSK signal. The degree of envelope modulation introduced is a function of the severity
    of the pulse shaping employed.<br>
    <br>
    Shown here are examples of PSK waveforms for various values of root raised cosine filter
    roll-off. As expected, the smaller the value of <font face="Symbol">a</font>, the sharper
    the filter and the higher the peaks of the PSK signal. (The <i>root</i> raised cosine
    filter is used here, as it is the <font color="#0080FF">peak power</font> rating of the <font color="#0080FF">transmitter</font>
    that is usually of most concern to designers.)<br>
    <br>
