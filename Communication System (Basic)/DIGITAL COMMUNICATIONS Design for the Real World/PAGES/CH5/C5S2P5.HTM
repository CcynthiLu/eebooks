<h2>Bandwidth limited ASK</h2>

<h3>Bandpass filtering method</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">In order to minimize the occupied bandwidth of the transmitted ASK signal,
    <a "" href="../ch3/c3s2p2.htm">filtering or pulse shaping</a> is required either prior to
    or after modulation onto a carrier.<br>
    <br>
    The switching method of ASK generation does not allow any pre-filtering of the modulating
    baseband symbol stream, as the switch is a <font color="#0080FF">non-linear process</font>
    and does not transfer the pulse-shaping information onto the carrier envelope. In this
    case, any filtering to constrain the bandwidth must be performed on the modulated bandpass
    signal. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">For example, if we wish to filter a 30&nbsp;kHz wide modulated signal
    superimposed on a carrier at 900&nbsp;MHz (typical of some digital cellular systems in the
    USA), this would imply a filter with a <font color="#0080FF">Quality factor</font>&nbsp;<I>Q</i>
     =&nbsp;900&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> /&nbsp;30&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>
     =&nbsp;30000. At present, this <I>Q</i> can only be achieved
    using crystal filters, which have very very poor amplitude ripple and group delay
    distortion in the passband. They certainly do not allow the designer to achieve the <a href="../ch3/c3s4p4.htm">root raised cosine bandpass</a> response required for zero
    intersymbol interference. <br>
