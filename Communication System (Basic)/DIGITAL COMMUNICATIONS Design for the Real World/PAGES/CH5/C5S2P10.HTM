<h2>Coherent detection vs non-coherent detection (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Let us now consider the case of detecting the ASK signal in the presence
    of noise. For simplicity we will assume that the carrier is in the 'off' state and that we
    have a specific noise component of length <i>N</i> and phase 60<sup>o</sup>.<br>
    <br>
    The non-coherent detector, which is performing amplitude detection, is simply measuring
    the <font color="#0080FF">length</font> of the composite (ASK + Noise) vector regardless
    of the vector phase. It would thus produce an output voltage proportional to <i>N</i>, the
    noise vector length.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The coherent detector, on the other hand, acts by mixing the incoming
    signal with the reference carrier cos&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>w</SPAN><sub>c</sub><i>t</i>. 
    The result is that the
    voltage at the detector output due to the noise is reduced by a factor cos(60<sup>o</sup>) 
    =&nbsp;0.5 and is thus proportional to <i>N</i>/2. If the noise vector happens to be in phase
    with the carrier reference, there is no reduction in noise, while if the noise vector is
    90<sup>o</sup> out of phase, the noise is reduced to zero. <BR>
<BR>
    On average, the coherent detection method reduces the noise voltage out of the detector by a factor of root 2
    and the noise power by 2. In other words, coherent detection of ASK can tolerate 3&nbsp;dB more
    noise than non-coherent ASK for the same likelihood of detection error. </td>
