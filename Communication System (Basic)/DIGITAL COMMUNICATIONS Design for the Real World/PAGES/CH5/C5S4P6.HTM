<h2>Carrier recovery for coherent PSK</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">In order to ensure that the local carrier phase is approximately 0°, it
    is necessary either to transmit a <font color="#0080FF">carrier phase reference</font>
    alongside the data signal, or to derive the reference from the incoming data signal. The
    concept of a separate reference signal has been discussed already in Chapter 4 as a means
    of detecting and correcting for <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p9.htm">local oscillator error</a>
    and <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p10.htm">Doppler shift</a> in mobile radio systems. <br>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">A data-derived reference for BPSK can be implemented by realizing that if
    the binary PSK signal is squared, the 0<sup>o</sup> and 180<sup>o</sup>
    phase states can be forced to be <font color="#0080FF">modulo 2<SPAN CLASS=greek>p</SPAN></font>, thereby removing
    the modulation. The process of squaring also doubles the frequency of the carrier
    component. This twice frequency term requires filtering (usually with a phase-locked
    loop), to remove channel noise, and then the frequency must be halved to yield the
    required coherent carrier term. </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%">For data systems using <i>N</i> different phase symbol states (<i>N</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 for
    binary-PSK), an <i>N<sup></i>th</sup> order non-linearity must be used to force the phase
    modulation to be modulo 2<SPAN CLASS=greek>p</SPAN>. The remainder of the carrier recovery process remains
    the same except that a frequency 'divide-by-<i>N' </i>circuit is needed to obtain the
    correct carrier frequency. </td>
