    <td width="50%">We have already seen that an ASK signal can be realized using a mixer to
    multiply the carrier with the baseband symbol stream. This is termed a <font color="#0080FF">linear modulation</font> process.<br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">A simpler alternative, particularly for binary ASK, is to use a switch to
    gate the carrier on and off, driven by the data signal. For more than two symbol states,
    this approach becomes quite complicated with the requirement to gate on carriers with
    differing amplitudes to represent the required number of symbol states. </td>
