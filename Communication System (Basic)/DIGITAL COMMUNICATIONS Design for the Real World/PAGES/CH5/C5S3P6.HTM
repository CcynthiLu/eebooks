<h2>Filtered FSK</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">As with ASK modulation, it is possible to control the spectral occupancy
    of CPFSK with a pulse-shaping filter prior to the modulator. In the case of FSK, however,
    there is not a one-to-one mapping between the pulse-shaped spectrum and the modulated
    spectrum owing to the non-linear modulation process (for example, the VCO).<br>

<h4>The effect of pulse shaping on the FSK spectrum is shown here for the
    unfiltered and filtered case. The filter commonly used is an unusual low pass filter
    called a <font color="#0080FF">Gaussian filter</font>, which is particularly well suited
    to achieving low spectral occupancy outside the FSK main lobe. A modern example of the use
    of this type of FSK, commonly termed <font color="#0080FF">Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying
    (GMSK)</font>, is within the European and North American (GSM-based) digital cellular
    systems. </h4>
