<h2>Symbol timing recovery</h2>

    <td width="100%">The discussion in Chapter 3 on <a "" href="../ch3/c3s2p2.htm">pulse
    shaping</a> for minimum intersymbol interference highlighted the need for accurate timing
    of the sampling point within each symbol. A common <font color="#0080FF">symbol timing
    circuit</font> is the <font color="#0080FF">early-late gate</font> synchronizer. This
    circuit works on the basis that the optimum point to sample the signal at the output of a <a "" href="../ch3/c3s5p1.htm">matched filter</a> detector is when the signal is at its
    maximum. <br>

    The early-late gate approach uses two such detectors, one fed with a slightly advanced
    timing reference and one fed with a slightly retarded timing reference. The outputs of the
    two detectors are then periodically compared to see which is the larger. The timing is
    then advanced in favour of the detector with the larger output in the expectation that it
    will get bigger. Eventually, the timing will be advanced too far and the detector output
    begins to fall. The equilibrium point occurs when both detector outputs are equal (one
    falling away from the peak and one rising towards it), and the optimum sampling point is
    then known to lie midway between the advanced and retarded references. This optimum timing
    signal is passed to a third data detector.<br>

    Two excellent references on timing and carrier recovery circuits are <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Lindsey">Lindsey (1972)</a> and
    <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Gardner">Gardner (1966)</a>. </td>
