<h2>Differential data decoding</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="40%">The differential decoding process is equally simple to implement using a
    second exclusive-or gate and a 1-bit delay. The task is to observe whether the detected
    data stream changes state over consecutive bits, in which case a logic 1 must have been
    present in the input. If there is no change of state, a logic 0 must have been sent. This
    change of state information is unaffected by any data inversion and hence the
    encoding/decoding process is foolproof against carrier recovery phase ambiguity.</td>
    <td width="60%"><img src="ch5figs/sec4/diff_dec.gif" align="right" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="135"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <h4 align="center"><img src="ch5figs/sec4/err_dec.gif" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="102"></h4>

  <h4>The only drawback with this coding process is that when single bit errors
    occur in the received data sequence due to noise, and so on, and pass through the decoder,
    they tend to propagate as <font color="#0080FF">double bit</font> errors. This is because
    the decoder is comparing the logic state of the most recently received data bit with the
    current data bit, and if the previous bit is in error, the next decoded bit will also be
    in error. </h4>
