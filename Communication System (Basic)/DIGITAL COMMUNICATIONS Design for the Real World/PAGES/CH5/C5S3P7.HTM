<h2>Non-coherent FSK detection</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">One of the simplest ways of detecting binary FSK is to pass the signal
    through two bandpass filters tuned to the two signalling frequencies and detect which has
    the larger output averaged over a symbol period. This is in essence a <a href="c5s2p7.htm">non-coherent envelope detector</a> for the equivalent two ASK streams
    with a comparator at the output. Because it takes no account of the phase of the
    respective symbols, this method, as expected from our discussions on <a href="c5s2p9.htm">ASK detection</a>, will not perform as well as coherent FSK detection
    systems. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">There are several alternative methods for discriminating between the
    incoming frequencies. One simple digital method involves counting the zero-crossings of
    the carrier during a symbol and hence directly estimating the frequency on a
    symbol-by-symbol basis. A third, often used method involves a <font color="#0080FF">phase-locked
    loop</font> which is described next. </td>
