<h2>Carrier recovery for coherent PSK (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">For practical filtered PSK, the squared signal contains an envelope
    modulation component which manifests itself as additional symmetrical frequency components
    around the twice carrier term. Fortunately a PLL-based filter is insensitive to envelope
    modulation and this will not significantly affect the performance of the carrier recovery
    circuit.</td>

    The filtering that is applied to the twice carrier term to reduce the effects of channel
    noise is, however, very important in reducing the amount of <font color="#0080FF">phase
    jitter</font> on the recovered carrier reference. There are some applications of digital
    communications, such as cellular radio, where it is not possible to employ a very narrow
    filter in the carrier recovery circuit. This is owing to the frequency uncertainty in the
    location of the twice carrier term caused by <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p9.htm">local
    oscillator error</a> and, more directly, variable amounts of <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p10.htm">Doppler shift</a> resulting from the user's motion. In these
    cases, the carrier recovery process can often have significant residual 'phase jitter'
    which degrades the performance for the expected ideal coherent PSK detector. </td>
