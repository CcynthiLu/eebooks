<h2>Network types: circuit and packet switched network operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img SRC="ch1figs/sec3/circ_sw.gif" align="left" width="150"></td>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Most modern networks operate in what is called a <font COLOR="#0080FF">circuit</font>
    or <font COLOR="#0080FF">packet</font> switched mode.<br>
    <br>
    A circuit switched network is one where at the start of each complete message transaction
    (for example, a telephone call), the route through the network is identified, the correct
    links are switched in, and this configuration is held for the entire duration of the call.</h4>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>A packet switched network, on the other hand, routes small chunks (<font
    color="#0080FF">packets</font>) of the message, hopefully down the best route (least
    congested, least noisy, and so on) available at the time.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>Packet switched networks are able to 'optimize' the routing of data
    on a packet-by-packet basis and hence these systems are very attractive for ensuring the
    best use of the network capacity &#150; particularly for unpredictable densities and duration
    of traffic such as Internet access. The protocol overhead for routing of individual
    packets, and for ensuring that packets arrive on time and in the right sequence when they
    have travelled by several different paths, makes the circuit switched approach more
    attractive for some applications such as voice traffic. There is, however, a trend towards
    using packet switched networks for voice also. </h4>
