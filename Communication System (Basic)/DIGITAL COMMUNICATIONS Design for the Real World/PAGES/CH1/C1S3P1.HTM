    <td width="50%"><h4>While this book is not intended to be a definitive text on the
    networking aspects of communications systems, this section has been included to allow the
    main focus of the book &#150; the design and performance of the <font color="#0080FF">modem</font>,
    to be appreciated within the wider context of its place in the communications network. A
    very good text on networking has been written by <a href="../ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Halsall">Halsall

    The <font color="#0080FF">network</font> is the all-embracing term for the collection of
    building blocks that make up a modern sophisticated communications system. It in general
    comprises <font color="#0080FF">physical interconnections</font> via cable, fibre, radio
    or infrared, <font color="#0080FF">modems</font> which process the information for
    reliable transmission through a given type of interconnection, and <font color="#0080FF">switches</font>
    (routers, exchanges), which are used to route the information between source and
    destination.</h4>
