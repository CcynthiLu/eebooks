    <h4>A simplex communications link is defined as one where the communication flow can only
    occur in one direction. A common example is broadcast radio or television. </h4>
    <font color="#0080FF"><h3>Half duplex</h3></font>
    <h4>A half-duplex communication link is capable of communication in both directions, but
    not at the same time. This form of communication is commonly employed in applications from
    'walkie-talkies' and CB-radio, through to professional police radio systems. </h4>
    <font color="#0080FF"><h3>Full duplex</h3></font>
    <h4>A full-duplex system, as one would expect, can support simultaneous two-way
    communication. The most widespread example is the telephone.</h4>
