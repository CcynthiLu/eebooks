<h2>The seven-layer OSI model</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>It is often the case that there are several types of signalling
    protocol running concurrently to control the information flow and processing within a
    network &#150; some dealing with information on a bit-by-bit basis, such as error correction
    protocols, and some operating at a much higher level to ensure that whole files of data
    are packaged correctly and arrive in sequence after transmission.<br>
    <br>
    These various levels of protocol are often categorized in terms of their function within a
    now standardised seven-layer model, known as the <font color="#0080FF">OSI seven-layer
    model</font>, as shown here. As the data passes through each layer of the network
    hierarchy, additional signalling information is usually added to pass information to the
    corresponding layers at the receive side. This can amount to a very large overhead for the
    system, particularly if the data packet size itself is small. </h4>
