<table border="0" width="100%">

    <td width="100%"><h3>Synchronous transmission </h3>
    <h4>A <font color="#0080FF">synchronous</font> system is one in which the transmitter and
    receiver are operating continuously at the same number of symbols per second and are
    maintained, by suitable correction, in the desired phase relationship.<br>
    <br>
    Synchronous operation requires an accurate timing signal in the receive modem, which can
    be derived either from a separate transmitted reference or from symbol transitions within
    the data signal itself. A separate reference requires additional power or bandwidth, while
    a data-derived reference requires frequent symbol transitions to occur in the received
    waveform, that is, long strings of 1s or 0s are not acceptable.</h4>
    <h3>Asynchronous transmission</h3>
    <h4>An <font color="#0080FF">asynchronous</font> system is one in which the symbol rate
    can vary marginally with time and no rigid timing constraint is applied.<br>
    <br>
    Asynchronous operation is usually characterized by the use of <font color="#0080FF">start</font>
    and <font color="#0080FF">stop</font> bits to signify the beginning and end of a character
    that is to be sent, for example. the <a href="C1S3P6.HTM">RS232</a> protocol.</h4>
