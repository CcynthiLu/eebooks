    <td width="100%"><h4>The <font color="#0080FF">data link layer</font> as defined in the <a
    HREF="C1S3P7.HTM" "">seven-layer OSI model</a> is focused on achieving reliable
    information transfer over the <font color="#0080FF">physical layer</font>, (the data
    modulation/demodulation process). This link layer includes the functions of error
    detection and message/packet retransmission.<br>
    <br>
    Two typesof link layer operation are usually defined - <font color="#0080FF">connectionless</font>
    and <font color="#0080FF">connection orientated</font>.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Connectionless operation</font> launches frames or packets into the network to be
    transferred to the destination, but with no tracking of the frames to ensure correct
    delivery, that is, if an error is detected in the frame or packet and it is discarded,
    there is no means of provision for a retransmission to occur. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Connection-orientated</font> operation, on the other hand, has all the built-in tracking
    mechanisms and facilities for retransmission to make sure that guaranteed error-free
    transmission occurs.<br>
    <br>
    Most of the remainder of this book is concerned with the <font color="#0080FF">physical
    layer</font> of the OSI model &#150; the means by which binary data is best communicated over
    the physical channel. <a "" href="../ch7/c7s1p1.htm">Chapter 7</a>, however, comes back to
    discuss some of the error detection and retransmission issues involved in the link layer. </h4>
