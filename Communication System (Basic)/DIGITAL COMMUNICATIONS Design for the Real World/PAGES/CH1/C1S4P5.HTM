<h2>Sources of link degradation (cont. 3)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><font color="#0080FF"><h3>Noise </font></h3>
    <h4>Noise is charcterized as <font color="#0080FF">random, unpredictable electrical
    signals from natural sources</font>, for example, atmospheric noise, thermal noise, shot
    noise, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    Because of the multiplicity of noise sources in a communications link, it is difficult to
    define the properties (frequency range, level and instantaneous phase) of noise and hence
    equally difficult to reduce its effect on the communications link performance. For
    convenience, most textbooks and indeed practising engineers assume noise to fall
    predominantly into the class of <a href="../ch4/c4s3p6.htm">Additive White Gaussian Noise
    (AWGN)</a> which does indeed form an adequate clasification for most cases. However, we
    should not forget that this is a <font color="#0080FF">general simplification</font> of
    the whole noise issue. </h4>
