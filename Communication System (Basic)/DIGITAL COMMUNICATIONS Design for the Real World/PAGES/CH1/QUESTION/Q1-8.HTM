<h2>Question 1.8</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A mixer has two inputs, one a square wave data
signal with fundamental frequency of 600&nbsp;Hz, and the other a carrier wave with frequency
of 10&nbsp;MHz. The carrier wave, however, is not a perfect sinusoid, but is partly limiting at
the top and bottom of the waveform such that it contains a second harmonic component
at a level of one-tenth of the fundamental. <BR>
<BR>
Sketch the output from the mixing process, assuming
that the square wave input is limited to the first five non-zero harmonics only.</h4>
