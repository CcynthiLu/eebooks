<h2>Answer 1.9</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The dc offset in the mixer can be viewed as an
additional dc component within the input data signal, which will mix with the carrier
component and result in what is usually termed <font color="#0080FF">carrier leakage</font> at the mixer
output in the centre of the modulation spectrum as shown below.<br>
<BR>
Carrier leakage occurs due to the carrier in high
frequency mixing processes simply feeding across the small gap between the local
oscillator input and mixer output, because of insufficient isolation.<br>
