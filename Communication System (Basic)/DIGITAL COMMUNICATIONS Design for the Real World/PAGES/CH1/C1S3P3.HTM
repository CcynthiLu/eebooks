<h2>Network hierarchy</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4> The PSTN provides a good example of transmission hierarchy within a
    network, where the connections carrying little traffic are served with low capacity links
    (for example, the twisted pair cable connection to the average home which can support up
    to 56&nbsp;kbps with a modem, or 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;64&nbsp;kbps with a special <font COLOR="#0080FF">ISDN
    (Integrated Services Digital Network)</font> line), through to the interconnections
    between the major cities which often comprise very high speed optical fibre links carrying
    in excess of 500&nbsp;Mbps and supporting over 7000 voice calls each.</h4>
