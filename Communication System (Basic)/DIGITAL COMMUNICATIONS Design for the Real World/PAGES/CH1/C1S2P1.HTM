    <br>
    In order to translate the spectrum of the input signal to fit within the passband of a
    channel, a process of modulation is employed as described in <a Href="../chapter5/ch5sc0p0.htm">Chapter 5</a>. This process often involves mixing the
    input data signal with a high frequency sine or cosine term, called the <font color="#0080FF">carrier</font>.</h4>
