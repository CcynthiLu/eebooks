<font color="#0080FF"><H3>Transmitter</H3></font>
<H4>The transmitter (TX) element processes message signal in order to produce a signal 
most likely to pass reliably and efficiently through the channel. This usually involves 
<A Href="../chapter5/c5s1p1.htm">modulation</A> of a carrier signal by the message signal, 
<A Href="../chapter7/c7s1p1.htm">coding</A> of the signal to help correct for tranmission 
errors, filtering of the message or modulated signal to constrain the occupied bandwidth, 
and power amplification to overcome channel losses. </H4>

<font color="#0080FF"><H3>Transmission Channel</h3></font>
<H4>Loosley defined as the electrical medium between source and destination, e.g. cable, 
optical fibre, free space, the channel is characterised by its 
<FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Loss/Attenuation</font>, <font color="#0080FF">Bandwidth</font>, 
<font color="#0080FF">Noise/Interference</font> and <font color="#0080FF">Distortion</FONT>. </H4>

<font color="#0080FF"><H3>Receiver </H3></font>
<H4>The receiver (RX) function is principally to <FONT COLOR="#0080FF">reverse</FONT> the modulation processing of the transmitter in order to recover the message signal, attempting to compensate for any signal degradation introduced by the channel.  This will normally involve amplification, filtering, demodulation and decoding and in general is a more complex task than the transmit processing. </H4>
