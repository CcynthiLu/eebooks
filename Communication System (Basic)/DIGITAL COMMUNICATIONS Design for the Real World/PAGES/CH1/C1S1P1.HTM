    <td width="100%"><h4>Before we can make sense of the issues important in the design of a
    digital communications link, it is essential to have a good grounding in the relationship
    between the shape of a digital waveform in the <font color="#0080FF">time domain</font>,
    and its corresponding spectral content in the <font color="#0080FF">frequency domain</font>.
    </h4>
    <h4>Many of the modulation processes to be described in this book become intuitive when
    working with the <font color="#0080FF">sine</font> and <font color="#0080FF">cosine</font>
    terms that make up the modulating signals. In contrast, in the time domain we have to deal
    with the more complex issues of correlation and convolution. To this end, the first two
    sections of this chapter present the basics of Fourier series and trigonometrical
    relationships, as a starting point or refresher course for the reader as required. </h4>
    <h4>The chapter also provides a broad-brush overview of <font color="#0080FF">network and
    protocol</font> aspects of data communications. This brief summary cannot do justice to
    the subject, which in some respects commands the lion's share of a digital
    communications system. The focus of this book however is on the modem part of the link,
    where we are concerned with getting the data bits (1s and 0s) which appear at the network
    interface over the channel in the most efficient (as regards cost, power, bandwidth, time)
    and error free manner. It is here, at the physical interface layer, that many of the
    biggest design challenges occur. </h4>
    <h4>The final section of the chapter provides a summary of terms and ideas used throughout
    the book, so that jargon does not defeat the reader at the first hurdle. </h4>
