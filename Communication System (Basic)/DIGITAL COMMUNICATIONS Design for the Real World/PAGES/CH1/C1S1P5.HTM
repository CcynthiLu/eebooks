    <td width="50%"><h4>The representation of a time domain signal by a summation of sine or
    cosine components is usually referred to as the <font color="#0080FF">spectrum</font> of
    the waveform. It is traditional to draw the spectrum as discrete lines on a graph, with
    the position of the lines on the x-axis representing the frequency of the component, and
    the height of the line representing the amplitude.<br>
    <br>
    Again, it is common practice to represent only the absolute value or magnitude of each
    component in the spectrum, however, one must not forget that in fact each term in
    the Fourier Series expansion could be made up of both sine and cosine terms at any given
    frequency and hence both <font color="#0080FF">magnitude</font> and <font color="#0080FF">phase</font>
    are required for a complete representation of the time domain signal. </h4>
