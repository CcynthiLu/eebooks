<h2>Waveform coding &#150; A/D converters</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The term <font color="#0080FF">waveform coding</font> is applied to
    source encoding methods that seek to digitise the incoming analogue waveform, without
    making use of any information about its frequency content or source parameters, and thus
    achieve more efficient coding. <br>
    <br>
    This method is the most flexible source coding technique, able to accommodate any type of
    input waveform regardless of the generating source, and is typified by the <font color="#0080FF">analogue to digital converter</font>.<br>

    <td width="50%">The A/D conversion process, often more grandly called <font color="#0080FF">pulse code modulation</font> in many textbooks, usually involves regular
    sampling of the input signal level and then a conversion of this sampled value into a
    number representing the level. The accuracy of the representation is governed primarily by
    the resolution of the A/D converter &#150; that is, how many data bits it uses to represent
    each measured value. Typical A/D converters use eight bits for telephony voice
    digitization, and 16 or 18 bits for HiFi music digitization. Some professional mixing
    desks use 24-bit converters! Most communications links will make use of the complementary <font color="#0080FF">digital to analogue (D/A) converter</font> in order to restore the
    analogue waveform samples from the received data words. </td>
