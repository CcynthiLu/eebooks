<h3>TCM and the Shannon limit</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The significant coding gain of TCM-based modems means that it is now
    possible to get very close to the Shannon limit for certain modulation types and coding
    levels. The implementation complexity may once have appeared daunting and almost
    impractical back in 1976 when the technique was first published (see <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Ungerboeck1976">Ungerboeck and Csajka (1976)</a>)
    , but today TCM modems are fully integrated into a single IC and available as credit
    card (PCMCIA) sized plug-ins for PCs. <br>
