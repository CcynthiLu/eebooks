<h2>Source, channel and modulation coding &#150; complete </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Having highlighted the major benefits of combining channel (bit level)
    and modulation (symbol level) coding, it begs the question of whether adding intelligent
    source coding to the pot will yield even further benefits. <br>

    <td width="50%"><br>
    The answer is undoubtedly yes, with some schemes already in use. Modern speech coders, for
    example, assign priority to certain bit patterns which are in turn assigned extra
    protection within the channel code. Similarly, key bits of information in an image are
    being given priority in the more recent image transmission systems. <br>
    <br>
    A number of research groups are also looking at the viability of mapping the source
    information directly to M-ary symbols, bypassing the bit encoding level altogether, in an
    attempt to further integrate and optimize the source, channel and modulation processing
    tasks. </td>
