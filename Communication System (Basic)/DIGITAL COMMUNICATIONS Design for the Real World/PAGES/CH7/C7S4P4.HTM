    <td width="100%">RS codes are a subset of BCH codes that operate at the block level rather
    than the bit level. In other words, the incoming data stream is first packaged into small
    blocks, and these blocks are then treated as a new set of <i>k</i> symbols to be packaged
    in to a <font color="#0080FF">super-coded</font> block of <i>n</i> symbols. The result is
    that the decoder is able to detect and correct complete errored blocks. It is thus
    possible for a whole block to be corrupted owing to a burst of errors in a deep fade, for
    example, and the receiver still to&nbsp; be able to reinstate the correct information. <br>
    <br>
    RS codes are often used in mobile radio systems where burst errors are common, either as
    an alternative to, or in addition to, interleaving. RS codes are also used as part of the
    error correcting mechanism in CD players. The inevitable scratches on the disk surface
    result in bursts of errors coming from the disc, making the RS code ideally suited to this
    task. </td>
