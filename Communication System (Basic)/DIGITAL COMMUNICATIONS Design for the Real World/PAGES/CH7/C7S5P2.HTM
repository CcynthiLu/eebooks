<h2>Soft decision decoding</h2> 

<h4>So far in this chapter, it has been implied that the decoding process is performed on 
the demodulated bit stream at the receiver output &#150; the so-called <font COLOR="#0080FF">hard decision</font> data.  
A hard decision means that the decoder is given no information of how close the received symbol 
was to the decision boundary, before the decision was taken. </h4>

<h4>By providing a decoder with 'side' information about how close each symbol was to the 
decision boundary, the decoder is able to place greater or lesser emphasis on the validity 
of any given symbol in its decoding process. In essence, the decoder tries to <font COLOR="#0080FF">weight</font> 
the decisions and form an overall view over many symbols as to the most likely transmitted 
symbol sequence.  This enhanced decoding process is called <font COLOR="#0080FF">soft decision</font> decoding.
