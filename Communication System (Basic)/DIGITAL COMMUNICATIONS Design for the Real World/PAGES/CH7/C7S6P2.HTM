<h2>Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM)</h2>

    <td width="100%">In 1976, G. Ungerboeck and I. Csajka published a very famous paper on
    this exact topic (see <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Ungerboeck1976">Ungerboeck and Csajka (1976)</a>), where they showed that in fact the
    potential <font color="#0080FF">coding gain</font> could indeed out-weigh the <I>E<sub>b</sub></i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub>
    penalty of increased symbol states, by 3&#150;4 dB! In a later paper (see <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Ungerboeck1982">Ungerboeck (1982)</a>)
    examples of M-ary PSK and M-ary QAM schemes with coding gains in excess of 6&nbsp;dB were
    presented. <br>
    <br>
    The efficient implementation of these coding schemes often makes use of the convolutional
    encoding and the trellis-based Viterbi decoding algorithms mentioned earlier. For this
    reason, this type of coding is often referred to as <font color="#0080FF">Trellis Coded
    Modulation (TCM)</font>. </td>
