<h2>Parity</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">A basic requirement of the ARQ system is for the receiving equipment to be
    able to detect the presence of errors in the received data. One of the simplest yet most
    frequently used techniques for detecting errors is the <font color="#0080FF">parity check
    bit</font>. Most people who have set up a modem for a computer link will have found a
    setting for <font color="#0080FF">odd</font> or <font color="#0080FF">even parity</font> alongside the number of stop bits, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    The parity check bit is usually a single bit (1 or 0) appended to the end of a data word
    such that the number of 1s in the new data word is <font color="#0080FF">even</font> for even parity, or <font color="#0080FF">odd</font>
    for odd parity.<br>
    <br>
    Thus for the first example data word shown here, a 0 must be added as the parity
    bit for an even parity design because the number of 1s in the word is already even. For
    the second word, there is an odd number of 1s so a logic 1 parity bit is added to
    make this number even. </td>
