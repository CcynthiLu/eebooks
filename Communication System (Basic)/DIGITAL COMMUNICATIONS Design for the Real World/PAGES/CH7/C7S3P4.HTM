<h2>Hamming codes &#150; an example of a block code</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><font color="#0080FF">Hamming codes</font>, named after their discoverer,
    R.W. Hamming, are a well-known type of block code. <br>
    <br>
    A rate <i>R</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;/&nbsp;7 Hamming code is illustrated here, with each of the 16 possible four-bit input
    blocks, coded as seven-bit output blocks. This set of 16 output blocks have been selected
    from the 2<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;128 possible seven-bit patterns as being most dissimilar. In this
    case, each output block can be seen to differ from all the other blocks by at least three
    bits. Hence, if one or two errors occur in the transmission of a block, the decoder will
    realize that this is not a valid block and flag an error. In the case of only a single bit
    error occurring, it is also possible for the receiver to match the received block to the
    closest valid block and thereby <font color="#0080FF">correct</font> the single error. If three errors occur in
    a block, the original block may be transformed into a new valid block and all the errors
    go undetected. </td>
