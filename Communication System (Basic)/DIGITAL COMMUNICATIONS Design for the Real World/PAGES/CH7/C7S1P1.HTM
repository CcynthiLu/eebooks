<h1>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding theory and practice</h1>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">To fully grasp the subject of coding for digital communications requires
    a very good working knowledge of mathematics and it is difficult to give an introduction
    to coding without either quickly losing the reader in complex equations and statistical
    theory, or providing a superficial overview which lacks rigour. This chapter attempts to
    inform the reader of the terminology and importance of coding for communications, but goes
    no further. Good texts on the subject include, of course, <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Proakis1989">Proakis (1989)</a> and <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Halsall">Halsall 
    (1992)</a>, from different perspectives.<br>
    <br>
    The term <font color="#0080FF">coding</font> is applied to many operations within a
    communications system, including: <ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Source coding </font>&#150; where an analogue or digital source is
        altered in some way to make it best suited for transmission purposes. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Channel coding</font> &#150; where extra information (redundancy) is
        added to an existing bit or symbol set in order to provide a means of detecting and/or
        correcting transmission errors. Usually channel coding involves operations on binary data.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Modulation coding</font> &#150; where a modulation symbol set
        (constellation) is expanded, again in order to allow the detection and correction of
        erroneous symbols. Modulation coding usually involves operations on analogue data symbols.
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In many modern communication links, combinations of source, channel and modulation
    coding are employed in a dependent manner to optimize performance. </td>
