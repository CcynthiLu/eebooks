<h2>Companding</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">

    <td width="50%">A method of reducing the number of bits required in a converter while
    achieving an equivalent dynamic range or signal to quantization noise ratio is to use a
    technique known as <font color="#0080FF">companding</font>. The term companding comes
    from a combination of the words COMPressing and expANDING, which adequately describe the
    process involved.<br>
    <br>
    Essentially, in order to improve the resolution of weak signals within a converter, and
    hence enhance the signal to quantization noise ratio, the weak signals need to be
    enlarged, or the quantization step size decreased, but only for the weak signals. Strong
    signals, on the other hand, can potentially be reduced without significantly degrading the
    signal to quantization noise ratio, or alternatively the quantization step size is
    increased.<br>
    <BR>This compression process must be matched with an equivalent expansion process in the D/A
    converter if the waveform integrity is to be maintained.</td>

    in particular, international standards have been set defining the compression and
    expansion ratios to be used for telephone interconnect throughout the world. There are in
    fact two standards, one predominantly a US standard called <font color="#0080FF"><font face="Symbol">m</font>-law</font> companding, and the other a European and <a ClASS="external" TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.itu.ch">ITU (International
