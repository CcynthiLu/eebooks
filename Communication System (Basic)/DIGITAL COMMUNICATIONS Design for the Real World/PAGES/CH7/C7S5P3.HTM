<h2>Trellis Diagrams</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">A frequently used pictorial representation of the convolutional encoding
    and decoding process is the <font color="#0080FF">trellis diagram</font>. At each stage in
    the trellis, a number of valid symbols or bit patterns exist, and over time, the decoder
    builds up a picture of the path exhibited by the received data through the trellis. <br>
    <br>
    With soft decision decoding, each element in the path can be weighted with a confidence
    factor using the 'side' information. The job of the decoder is, in effect,&nbsp; to check
    all possible paths through the trellis (not just the most apparent one) and add up all the
    weights over <i>N</i> sections, to see which path in fact gives the highest confidence rating.
    This path is then chosen as the correct set of received symbols and is decoded to give the
    output bit stream. </td>

    process and in recent years has been effectively fabricated on silicon. More information
    on trellis coding and the Viterbi algorithm can be found in <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Ziemer">Ziemer and Peterson (1992)</a>. </td>
