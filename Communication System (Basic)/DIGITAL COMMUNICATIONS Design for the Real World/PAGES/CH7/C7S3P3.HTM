<h2>Coding efficiency</h2>

    <td width="100%">The <font color="#0080FF">efficiency</font> of a code is a measure of how
    well errors can be detected or corrected versus the bit overhead required to implement the
    code. In the ball analogy, colour coding the balls may be very effective, but adding
    colour may introduce a very high overhead of data, and perhaps changing the ball shape may
    provide the same error detection or correction capability, but use fewer additional data
    bits. This would therefore be classed as a more efficient coding scheme. <br>
    <br>
    Certain code types are better at <font color="#0080FF">detecting</font> errors than <font color="#0080FF">correcting</font> them, and these are thus well suited to <a "" href="c7s2p1.htm">ARQ schemes</a> where we need to know an error has occurred, and our
    corrective action is to request a retransmision. Equally, there are codes that are best
    suited for correcting errors and these would be used where no retransmission was possible.
    A good example for this type of code would be paging devices, or missile control systems! </td>
