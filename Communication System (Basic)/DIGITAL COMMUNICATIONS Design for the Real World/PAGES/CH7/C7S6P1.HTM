<h1>7.6 Combined coding and modulation </h1>
<!--Body Text Here-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The problem with all the coding schemes described thus far is that they
    all increase the amount of data to be transmitted, requiring either increased transmission
    bandwidth or reduced channel capacity if the bandwidth is fixed. <br>
    <br>
    There is, however, one obvious method to recover any capacity loss and that is to increase
    the number of symbol states in the modulation scheme. We know that this will incur a large
    <I>E<sub>b</sub></i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub> penalty, but is this more or less than the coding gain
    that we can achieve with the extra channel capacity obtained? </td>
