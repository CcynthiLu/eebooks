<h2>Nyquist sampling </h2>

<h4>The minimum rate at which an arbitrary waveform can be sampled <font color="#0080FF">without loss of information</font> is in fact twice the bandwidth of
    the input waveform. </h4>
<h4>This is known as the <font color="#0080FF">Nyquist sampling criterion</font>. Sampling
    at less than twice the bandwidth of the input signal (equivalent to twice the maximum
    modulation frequency for baseband signals) results in what is termed <font color="#0080FF">aliasing</font>.

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The Nyquist sampling requirement can be derived intuitively from our
    knowledge of <a "" href="../ch1/c1s1p3.htm">Fourier Series</a> summarized in Chapter 1. We
    can view the sampling process as the mixing of the input signal with a train of very
    narrow data sampling pulses which will result in sum and difference components appearing
    at the mixer output for each harmonic of the pulse waveform mixing with the signal
    waveform as shown. This is the spectrum that would effectively appear at the output of a
    D/A converter. In order to reconstruct the input waveform correctly, the D/A output
    needs to be filtered so that only the spectral components present within the source signal
    remain. </td>
