    <td width="100%"><h4>The images shown here are good examples of how intelligent source
    coding can pay off. The first image uses conventional image coding techniques designed for
    data channels that exhibit a random distribution of bit errors with time. When subject to
    a channel that produces short, focused bursts of errors, the decoded image is severely
    degraded. The second image has been passed through an encoder/decoder designed to be
    resilient to burst errors, and clearly demonstrates the marked improvement that can be
    achieved if the source coding is tailored to the channel error conditions - where known. <br>
