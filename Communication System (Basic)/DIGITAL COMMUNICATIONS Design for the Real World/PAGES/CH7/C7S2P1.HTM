<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#0080FF">Channel coding</font> is most often applied to
    communications links in order to improve the reliability of the information being
    transferred. By adding additional bits to the transmitted data stream (which of course
    increases the amount of data to be sent), it is possible to detect and even correct for
    errors in the receiver. <br>

    <td width="50%"><ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Error detection schemes</font> &#150; In its most elementary form this involves
        recognizing that part of the received information is in error and, if appropriate or
        possible, requesting a repeat transmission &#150; <font color="#0080FF">ARQ (Automatic Repeat

  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><ul>
      <li><font color="#0080FF">Error detection and correction</font> &#150; With added complexity, it is possible not only to
        detect errors, but also to build in the ability to correct errors without recourse to
        retransmission. This is particularly useful where there is no feedback path to the
        transmission source with which to request a resend. This process is known as <font color="#0080FF">FEC (Forward Error Correction)</font>. </li>
