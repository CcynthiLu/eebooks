<h2>Soft vs hard decision decoding</h2>
<!--proofed by DR 7/6-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">As would be expected, a soft decision decoding scheme has a better chance
    of detecting and correcting errors than a hard decision scheme. <br>
    <br>
    If there is unlimited and unquantized weighting information available to the decoder, then
    the soft decision decoder should provide up to <font color="#0080FF">3&nbsp;dB coding gain</font>
    improvement over a hard decision decoder for the same code length. If the weighting
    information is quantized to only eight levels, the coding gain is reduced to approximately
    2.75&nbsp;dB. <br>
    <br>
    It is common for soft decision decoders to use eight or fewer weighting levels to avoid
    undue complexity in the decoder hardware/software. </td>
