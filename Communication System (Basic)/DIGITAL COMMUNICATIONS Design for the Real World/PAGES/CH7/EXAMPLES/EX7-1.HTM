<h2>Example 7.1</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A broadcast audio source signal contains frequencies
in the range from 50&nbsp;Hz to 18&nbsp;kHz. What is the minimum sampling rate required for an A/D
converter in order to ensure that there will be no aliasing? What is a practical sampling
rate to choose for this application?</h4>

<h4 CLASS="technical">If by accident a high frequency tone at 30&nbsp;kHz is
added into the audio source, at what frequency will this signal appear in the sampled
waveform if the sampling rate is set at 40000&nbsp;samples per second?</h4>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4 CLASS="technical">The Nyquist sampling rate for perfect signal
reconstruction (no aliasing) must be twice the highest frequency component of a baseband
signal, that is, 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;18&nbsp;kHz =&nbsp;36000&nbsp;samples per second. This sampling rate assumes that a
'brick-wall' low pass filter can be used to remove alias components. In practice, a
sampling rate of 44100&nbsp;samples per second is commonly used in the HiFi industry as the
standard sampling rate for high quality audio signals with frequencies up to 20&nbsp;kHz.<br>
<BR>
If a sampling rate of 40000 samples per second is used to digitize a
tone with a frequency of 30&nbsp;kHz, the sampling process will produce a difference frequency
component at (40000&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;30000) =&nbsp;10000&nbsp;Hz, which falls well within the half Nyquist
bandwidth of 20&nbsp;kHz for a 40&nbsp;kHz sampled system. It would thus appear that a 10&nbsp;kHz tone
had been applied at the input to the A/D converter.</h4>
