<h2>Example 7.2</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A telephone system uses filters to band limit the
signal from each user to a maximum of 4&nbsp;kHz. The maximum signal generated by each user is
1&nbsp;V, and the minimum signal that must be supported is 72&nbsp;dB below this value. What is the
minimum bit rate that must be supported by the telephone system for each user on the
network?
<BR>
<BR>If companding is used within the A/D conversion
process to achieve equivalent dynamic range, but with only eight bits, what will be the
bandwidth required of a binary baseband data link for a single digitized voice channel? If
32 channels are multiplexed into an E1 frame, what is the number of bits per frame and the
data rate on the E1 link?</h4>
<h3>Solution</h3>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A 4&nbsp;kHz maximum input signal requires a minimum
sampling rate of 8000&nbsp;samples per second. In order to maintain a 72&nbsp;dB dynamic range, the
A/D converters must use 72/6 =&nbsp;12&nbsp;bits, giving a total bit rate per telephone channel of
8000&nbsp;x&nbsp;12 =&nbsp;96000&nbsp;bps.<br>
<br>
With the use of companding, the bit rate per channel
reduces to 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;8000 =&nbsp;64&nbsp;kbps. For a baseband channel, the maximum bandwidth efficiency is
2&nbsp;bits/second/Hz for binary signalling, hence 32&nbsp;kHz of bandwidth is needed per voice band.<BR>
<BR>
For 32 channels per frame, the frame length of the
E1 line is 32&nbsp;x&nbsp;8 =&nbsp;256&nbsp;bits. The frame rate must equal the sampling rate of any one of
the channels, that is, 8000&nbsp;frames per second, hence the E1 data rate =&nbsp;256&nbsp;x&nbsp;8000 =&nbsp;2048&nbsp;Mbps.<br>
<BR>
A description of the E1 and T1 channel types is given in Section 1.3.)</h4>
