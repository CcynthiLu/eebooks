    evenly and randomly between incoming blocks. This is usually the case for channels

    <td width="100%">In a mobile radio environment, however, errors often occur in bursts as
    the received signal fades in and out due to the multipath propagation and the user's
    motion. In order to distribute these errors more evenly between coded blocks, a process
    known as <font color="#0080FF">interleaving</font> is used. </td>
