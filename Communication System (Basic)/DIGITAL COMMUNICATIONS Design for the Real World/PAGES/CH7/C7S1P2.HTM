<h1>7.1 Source coding </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The purpose of <font color="#0080FF">source coding</font> is to transform
    the information type in the source to a form best suited to the transmission process.
    Often this involves converting an analogue signal such as voice or light intensity in an
    image to a digital binary representation for transmission using a modem. </td>

    <td width="100%">These days, the source coding process will usually implement an algorithm
    to realize bit or symbol content compression in addition to the standard process of
    quantization and A/D conversion. Standard image compression algorithms are the <A CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.mpeg1.de">MPEG</a> and <A CLASS="external" TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/jpeg-faq/top.html">JPEG</a> formats for moving and
    static images respectively. At the present time, the source coding for music and speech is
    not so well standardized, with many different formats in use throughout the world. <br>
    <br>
    In most, but not all cases, a complementary decoder is implemented to restore the signal
    to near or exactly its original format. </td>
