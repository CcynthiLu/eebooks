<h2>Voice coding (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The source coding discussion so far has focused on a particular type of
    linear waveform encoding which, while very flexible and widely used, leads to a high data
    transmission rate (64&nbsp;kbps per telephone voice channel), for the encoded signal. In many
    applications where transmission capacity is limited, often because of restricted channel
    bandwidth, it is desirable to achieve a much lower data rate for the encoded signal,
    hopefully without incurring any significant degradation in the perceived (subjective)
    quality of the signal.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">If we are not concerned with preserving the waveform shape perfectly, but
    rather we wish to maintain the subjective quality of the received signal &#150; visual or audio
    fidelity &#150; then we can move away from waveform coding and use more sophisticated <font color="#0080FF">frequency domain</font> or <font color="#0080FF">source modelling</font>
    (parametric) based methods.<br>

    The subject of voice coding is vast, and falls outside the scope of this book. A good
    reference is <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Papamichalis">Papamichalis (1987)</a>. A techniques that is proving to give good voice quality
    and good compression performance is based on <font color="#0080FF">linear predictive
    coding</font> which in part attempts to model the actual human voice synthesis process.
    Data rates of the order of 7000&nbsp;bps are now considered to give acceptable voice quality
    telephone communications (compared with 64&nbsp;kbps for the standard waveform codec), and
    these techniques are used extensively in modern digital cellular systems. </td>
