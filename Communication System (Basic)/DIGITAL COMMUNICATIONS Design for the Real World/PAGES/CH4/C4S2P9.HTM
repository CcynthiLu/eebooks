<h3>Local oscillator error</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>For any bandpass modulation process it is necessary to generate
    sinewaves in both transmitter and receiver systems, ideally with precisely the same
    frequency and phase. This begs the question: Is it possible to implement two or more
    sinewave generators with perfect frequency and phase accuracy under realistic operating
    conditions (temperature variation, supply variation, ageing, and so on)? </h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>A reasonably cost-effective crystal oscillator (&lt;$10) may have the
    stablity of 1&nbsp;ppm (part per million) over a given temperature range. This means that for a
    telephone modem with a carrier of say 2&nbsp;kHz, the oscillators at each end of the link could
    have an error of +/&#150;1.10<sup>&#150;6</sup>&nbsp;x&nbsp;2.10<sup>3</sup> =&nbsp;0.002&nbsp;Hz. If we could
    ensure that both transmit and receiver carrier oscillators begin with the same phase, then
    we could expect the phase error between them to reach 360<sup>o</sup> after 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.004
    =&nbsp;250&nbsp;seconds, and 90<sup>o</sup>, giving zero output, after 75&nbsp;seconds.
    These figures suggest that, providing an initial phase correction can be achieved,
    near phase-coherent detection can be ensured for a few seconds without further phase
    correction being required.</h4>

    a carrier of 1&nbsp;GHz, then the oscillator frequency error for a 1-ppm source is +/&#150;1000&nbsp;Hz. Here, it is clear that simply achieving a correct starting phase will not
    allow us to ensure adequate coherency for more than a few microseconds. In this
    application, it is necessary to find a method of correcting the receiver carrier
    oscillator frequency and phase to match that of the transmitter. This process is termed <a "" href="../ch5/c5s2p11.htm">carrier recovery</a>.</h4>
