<h2>Phase distortion &#150; filters</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Just as filters introduce amplitude ripple in the passband, many also
    have phase variations across the passband and in the transition band. The effect of a
    non-flat phase response in a filter is to cause the various frequency components that make
    up the data signal to undergo slightly different amounts of <font color="#0080FF">phase
    shift</font>. If the phase response is not flat, or does not increase linearly with
    frequency (termed a <font color="#0080FF">linear phase response</font>), distortion will
    be introduced into the time waveform of the data pulse or symbol as shown here. If the
    component has a linear phase response, this translates into a fixed time delay of the
    signal passing through it, but otherwise the signal will <font color="#0080FF">not</font> be distorted.</h4>

    Again, some filters have better phase responses than others, with the <font color="#0080FF">Bessel</font> filter
    having a very good near linear phase response with frequency, and the <font color="#0080FF">Elliptic</font>
    filter having a very poor response. <font color="#0080FF">Digital filters</font>, on the
    other hand, can be implemented with <font color="#0080FF">perfectly linear phase response</font>
    &#150; so-called linear phase filters and hence it is possible to implement a <a "" href="../ch3/c3s4p1.htm">raised cosine</a> filter with no phase distortion using these
    techniques. (Note, not all digital filters have a linear phase response.)</h4>
