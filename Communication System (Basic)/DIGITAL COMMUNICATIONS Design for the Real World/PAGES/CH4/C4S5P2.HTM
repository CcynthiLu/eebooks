<h2>Multipath distortion</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In applications where more than one propagation path will exist, the
    interaction of the signals from these multiple paths at the receiver (multipath
    propagation) gives rise to significant distortion of the received data symbols.<br>
    <br>
    The same source signal, arriving by a different route, will experience a different path
    length and hence a different propagation delay. This difference in delay will result in
    different phases between the two received signals. If the phase difference approaches 180<sup>o</sup>
    then the signals will in fact partially cancel each other, while if the phase difference
    approaches 0<sup>o</sup> they will reinforce. </h4>
