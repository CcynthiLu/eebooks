    <td width="50%"><h4>Most interference encountered in digital communications systems
    (except for deep space missions!) arises from either other communications systems or
    machinery. For example, <font color="#0080FF">crosstalk</font> in telecommunications lines
    is classed as interference, as is the <font color="#0080FF">ignition noise</font>
    generated by a car engine.</h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>In radio systems in particular, a major source of interference is from
    other users of the radio spectrum. For example, equipment radiating on frequencies close
    to the wanted channel can pass through the receiver selection filtering, causing what is
    termed <font color="#0080FF">adjacent channel</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>interference.
    In cellular applications, mobile users in different geographical locations are assigned
    the same frequency for their calls, and if they are not separated by sufficient distance, <font color="#0080FF">co-channel interference</font> occurs.<br>
    <br>
    In both radio and television, <font color="#0080FF">multipath interference</font> is
    common, manifest as <i>ghosting </i>on the television screen, caused by signals travelling
    by many different paths between transmitter and receiver each with slightly different time
    delay. </h4>
