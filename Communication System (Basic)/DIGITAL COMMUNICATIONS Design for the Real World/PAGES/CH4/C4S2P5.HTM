<h2>Group delay &#150; filters</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">

    <td width="50%"><h4><font color="#0080FF">Group delay</font> is defined as <font color="#0080FF">the rate of change
    of phase shift with frequency</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"></font>. For a filter with a
    linear phase response, the rate of change of phase with frequency is constant and hence
    the group delay will be a fixed, though non-zero, value over all frequencies, that is, a
    pure time delay. <br>
    <br>
    For a non-linear phase response, the group delay will vary with frequency as shown here,
    with the effect that data pulses or symbols passing through the filter are smeared by the
    different delays across the frequency components, reintroducing ISI into the signal. Both
    gain and phase/group delay distortion can be compensated to some extent with the use
    of equalization circuits, which in practice are themselves digital filters which are
    configured to compensate for the imperfections of the usually analogue filters within the
    system, or imperfections in the channel itself. </h4>
