<h2>Phase distortion &#150; amplifiers</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="40%"><h4>Just as high power sources such as amplifiers and lasers have
    non-linear amplitude response with input power, they also usually have a non-linear phase
    response with input power. The phase response with frequency, however, is in practice
    quite linear and does not pose a problem unless very wide modulation bandwidths are being
    employed.<br>
    <br>
    The effect of phase change with power level is to cause an amplitude-dependent phase
    distortion of the data signal, often termed <font color="#0080FF">AM-PM distortion</font>,
    (Amplitude Modulation to Phase Modulation). This has a particularly detrimental effect on
    phase based modulation formats such as <a "" href="../ch6/c6s4p1.htm">M-ary PSK</a> or <a "" href="../ch6/c6s5p1.htm">M-ary QAM</a> which suffer unwanted rotation of the phase
    states of each symbol. </h4>
