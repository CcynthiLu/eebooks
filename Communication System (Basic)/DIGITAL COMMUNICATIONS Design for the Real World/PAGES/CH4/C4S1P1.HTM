    <td width="50%"><h4>Having dealt in Chapter 3 with many of the issues surrounding
    practical filtering for digital communications systems in an idealized channel context,
    this chapter is aimed at injecting a bit of reality into the design process by considering
    the characteristics of a range of typical channels.<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>All communications links are ultimately limited by background noise
    in the system, and so it is essential to have a working knowledge of the <font color="#0080FF">statistical properties</font> of noise as they affect data communications
    performance. Also, many channels are subject to interference, usually man-made, which can
    be equally detrimental to communications integrity. Thirdly, no communications link is
    truly distortion free, whether this be caused by imperfections in the processing hardware
    or defects within the channel, and the nature and impact of distortion on a digital
    communications system must be understood if good design choices are to be made.<br>
    <br>
    In order to 'root' the discussion of noise, interference and distortion in reality, this
    chapter concludes with sections outlining the characteristics of two channel types in
    everyday use: the telephone channel and the radio channel. </h4>
