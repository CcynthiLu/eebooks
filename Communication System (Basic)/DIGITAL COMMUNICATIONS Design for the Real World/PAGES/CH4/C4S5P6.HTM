<h2>Coping with multipath fading</h2>

<h3>Reference sounding</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Multipath fading is both a blessing and a curse for wireless digital
    communications systems. Were it not for the echoes of the transmitted signal caused by
    reflections from buildings, signals would not reach the user nestled within the crowded
    shopping street where the line-of-sight path to the transmitter is totally obscured. On
    the other hand, mitigating against distortion caused by multiple signals arriving at a
    receiver is a non-trivial task.<br>
    <br>
    If the fading is 'flat' with frequency, then a common method of combating the
    multipath-induced amplitude and phase variations is to use a 'reference sounding signal'.
    By sending a known frequency tone or periodic known data symbols alongside the message
    data, these references can be used to measure in real time the instantaneous amplitude and
    phase variations imposed by the channel (see <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Bateman1990">Bateman (1990)</a>). For flat fading, it can be
    inferred that similar gain and phase distortions are imposed on all other frequency
    components in the message signal. The information gleaned from the reference can thus be
    used to subtract out the distortion from the message data.</h4>
