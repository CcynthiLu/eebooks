<h2>Multipath fading &#150; the time domain problem</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>If the multipath delays, typically a few microseconds for outdoor
    communications, are significant with respect to the symbol period, then <font color="#0080FF">intersymbol interference</font> will occur. Note: this effect of multipath
    propagation is not an additional form of distortion to frequency selective fading but
    rather the same effect viewed in the time domain.<br>
    <br>
    To overcome the problem, channel equalizers are often employed which need to respond
    (adapt) to the changing nature of the channel. Alternatively, the symbol rate must be
    reduced by using <a "" href="../ch6/c6s1p1.htm">M-ary signaling</a> or many parallel
    channels so that the delay becomes a less significant proportion of the symbol period
    (typically &lt;10%)</h4>

    cellular telephone signal as it propagates within a city centre. The spread of time delays
