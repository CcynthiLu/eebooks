<h2>Coping with multipath fading</h2>

<h3>Channel equalizers</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>For high-speed wireless data applications where pilot sounding or
    parallel transmission is not appropriate or there is not sufficient bandwidth available to
    spread the signal effectively, then it is necessary to use wideband channel
    equalization techniques. These in effect involve sending a sounding pulse into the channel
    and measuring the level, phase and time delay of each significant echo received from the
    various transmission paths. The receiver then has to work out the<font color="#0080FF">
    inverse channel transfer function</font> with which to correct the subsequent message
    data.<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Because the strength, number and delay of the echoes vary with time as
    the user moves, this channel sounding must be repeated frequently and a new inverse
    channel transfer function calculated each time. A modern example of this approach to
    combatting multipath is contained within the <A TARGET="_BLANK" CLASS="external" HREF="http://www.gsmworld.com">GSM digital cellular system</a>. 
    The modulation bandwidth for GSM is 200&nbsp;kHz which means that
    the fading is frequency selective and equalization is necessary. A sounding data sequence
    is sent embedded in the centre of each GSM data packet (frame) which is repeated every 4.615&nbsp;ms.
    In other words, the cellular phone is working out the echo response of its
    surroundings at a rate of approximately 200 times per second. </h4>
