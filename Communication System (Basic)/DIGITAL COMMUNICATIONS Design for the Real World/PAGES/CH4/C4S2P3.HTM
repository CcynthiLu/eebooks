<h2>Gain distortion &#150; the channel</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>The channel itself can introduce gain distortion via a variety of
    mechanisms. Wired channels exhibit a general roll-off of amplitude with frequency due to
    the capacitive nature of long lengths of cable causing a low pass filtering effect. Also,
    poor termination of cables at the end-user equipment can itself introduce distortion. Some
    telephone lines in particular exhibit a very poor amplitude response.<br>
    <br>
    Wireless links do not suffer the capacitance problems of cables, but instead suffer from
    variable path loss due to the unpredictable nature of the communications path. This path
    loss can be either flat with frequency, or <font color="#0080FF">frequency dependent</font>,
    depending on the bandwidth of the modulation signal, the operating frequency and the path
    distance. These issues are dealt with more fully in <a "" href="c4s5p1.htm">Section 4.5</a>.
