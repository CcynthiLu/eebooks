<h2>Sources of noise</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Unlike interference, noise originates predominantly from within the
    communications link itself and is usually totally random in nature, making it very
    difficult to deal with. There is a variety of mechanisms by which noise is generated, the
    most commonly referenced forms being thermal noise, shot noise, flicker noise and
    atmospheric noise.</h4>

    <td width="100%"><h4><font color="#0080FF">Thermal noise</font> often dominates in
    communicationssystems and originates from the free movement of electrons within a
    conductor. The name arises because the energy and hence degree of movement of electrons
    increases proportionally with the temperature of the conductor. The current and hence
    voltage generated by this movement has a waveform that is entirely random in nature and
    which will, over time, have an average power spectrum that is flat over all frequencies.
    This property of thermal noise to contain all frequencies has resulted in it being called <font color="#0080FF">white noise</font> to mirror the property of white light to contain all
    colours.<br>
