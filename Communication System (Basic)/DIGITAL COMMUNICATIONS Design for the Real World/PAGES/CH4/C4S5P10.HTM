<h2>Coping with multipath fading</h2>

<h3>Directional antenna</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>One logical way to reduce the effect of multipath fading is to reduce
    the number of paths seen by the receiver. This in practice means using a <font color="#0080FF">directional antenna</font> on either the transmitting unit or receiving
    unit, or both.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to make an antenna directive at low
    radio frequencies (below a few hundred MHz), without requiring a very large physical
    structure.</h4>
    <h4>As the frequency of operation increases, the physical size of the antenna can be
    reduced in line with the reducing wavelength, and directivity is much more easily
    realized.</h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>For example, television aerials achieve modest directivity by having
    several elements in an array and this leads to a significant reduction in <font color="#0080FF">ghosting</font> (caused by multipath echoes) of the signal on the
    television screen. Microwave links achieve very good directivity by using a parabolic
    reflector. It is clearly not sensible to put a fixed directional antenna on a moving
    object, the orientation of which will change with time, and under these circumstances, the
    only solution is to try to implement an <font color="#0080FF">adaptive directional antenna</font> that can track
    the wanted signal over time. </h4>
