<h2>Multipath fading</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>If either the transmitter, receiver or reflectors are moving within a
    multipath environment, the path lengths will vary with time and so the relative phases
    between signals will also vary with the position of the users. The result is that the
    receiver experiences a combined signal with fluctuating amplitude and phase as a function
    of time. </h4>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>The depth of the resulting fading of the signal is very
   dependent on whether a strong <font color="#0080FF">line-of-sight</font> path exists between transmitter and
    receiver, in which case the fading signal envelope usually conforms to a <font
    color="#0080FF">Ricean statistical distribution</font>, whereas&nbsp; the line-of-sight
    path is obscured, and energy arrives at the receiver by a large number of reflections,
    then a <font color="#0080FF">Rayleigh distribution</font> of the envelope level is more
    likely to occur. The characteristics of the fading signal envelope make a significant
    impact on the bit error rate performance for a digital communications link. An excellent
    book on multipath fading is <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Jakes">Jakes (1993)</a>, and a very thorough text on the performance of
    data modems in fading is given in <a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Proakis1989">Proakis (1989)</a>. </h4>
