<h2>Predicting multipath distortion</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In order to design wireless digital communications systems that can
    best cope with the multipath environment in which they must operate, it is very helpful to
    be able to predict and simulate these effects in the system design phase. Apart from
    statistical prediction tools based on extrapolations from measured propagation data, one
    of the most accurate and versatile modelling techniques is based on <font color="#0080FF">ray-tracing.</font></h4>

    <td width="100%"><h4>In a ray-tracing system, the <font color="#0080FF">reflective</font>,
    <font color="#0080FF">refractive</font> and <font color="#0080FF">dispersive</font>
    properties of physical objects are modeled within a computer, along with their
    three-dimensional position. Every possible path that could be taken by a signal passing
    from transmitter to receiver is then traced by the computer, building up a picture of the
    level, angle of arrival and time delay of each one. From this information, it is possible
    to determine the frequency response of the channel, and to simulate the effects of the
    multipath fading on actual modem performance. This technique is very similar to that used
    to produce real-world lighting effects on virtual 3-D models created in a computer. </h4>
