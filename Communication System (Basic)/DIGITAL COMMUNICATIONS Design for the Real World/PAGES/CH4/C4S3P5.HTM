<h2>Shot, flicker and atmospheric noise</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4><font color="#0080FF">Shot noise</font> is generated within
    semiconductor junctions when electrons cross a potential barrier. Whereas thermal noise
    power is proportional to temperature, shot noise power is proportional to the bias current
    in the semiconductor. The nature of shot noise is also purely random and has a flat power
    spectrum with frequency. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Flicker noise</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>is also
    generated in semiconductors and is proportional to the dc bias current, but differs in
    that the noise power decreases with frequency. Because this power variation is almost
    directly proportional to 1/<i>f</i>, it is sometimes called <font color="#0080FF">1/<i>f</i>
    noise</font>.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Atmospheric noise</font> is a general term given to noise arising
    from electromagnetic radiation from solar and galactic sources. Certain stars, for
    example, emit definite and regular amounts of noise which are best avoided by pointing the
    antenna away from the noise source. The compound effect of this noise is usually expressed
    as an equivalent <font color="#0080FF">sky noise temperature</font> and is generally much
    less than thermal noise. The level of noise varies considerably with frequency, with the
    higher levels of noise occurring in the microwave region of the spectrum. </h4>
