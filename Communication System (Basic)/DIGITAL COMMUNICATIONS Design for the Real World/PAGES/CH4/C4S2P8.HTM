<h3>Frequency errors</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>Frequency errors within a communications link are caused by two
    mechanisms &#150; inaccuracy of the frequency sources used in the modulation and demodulation
    process, and Doppler shift caused by the relative motion between source and receiver or
    from moving reflectors. <br>
    <br>
    For modulation formats that use frequency or phase to represent different symbols, such as
    <a "" href="../ch6/c6s4p1.htm">M-ary PSK </a>or <a "" href="../ch6/c6s5p1.htm">M-ary QAM</a>,
    frequency errors can lead to significant performance degradation for the modem. </h4>
