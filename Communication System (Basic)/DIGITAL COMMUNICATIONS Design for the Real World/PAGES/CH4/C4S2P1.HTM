<h1>4.2 Gain, phase and group delay distortion </h1>

<h2>Gain distortion &#150; filters</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Most communications hardware &#150; filters, mixers, amplifiers, and so on,
    and most channel types, cable, fibre, radio, infra red, introduce amplitude distortion
    into a signal, usually with a frequency-dependent response.<br>
    <br>
    Filters, for example, are never perfectly 'flat' in the passband but all exhibit some
    degree of 'amplitude ripple'. Some filter types such as Elliptic or Chebychev filters have
    very high passband ripple, but also achieve very fast roll-off. Other filters such as
    Butterworth or Bessel filters have much less ripple but also much slower roll-off. <br>
    <br>
    The <a HREF="../Ch3/C3s4p1.htm">raised cosine</a> filter also exhibits passband ripple,
    depending on the length (number of taps) used in the filter implementation. The degree of
    ripple can be made arbitrarily small with very long filter length, but at the expense of
    processing delay and complexity. In practice, the amplitude ripple in a digital raised
    cosine filter does not significantly degrade modem performance; however, other filtering
    within the communications system such as the crystal or ceramic filters used in radio IF
    (intermediate frequency) circuits can exhibit gross levels of amplitude distortion and
    this effect cannot be ignored. </h4>
