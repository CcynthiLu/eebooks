    <td width="50%"><h4>The wireless channel is unique in that it is an <font color="#0080FF">unguided
    medium</font> (unlike cable or fibre), and it is the means by which signals <font color="#0080FF">propagate</font>
    from transmitter to receiver that dominates the data communications performance on a

    <td width="50%"><h4>In essence there is little inherent filtering or distortion in a
    wireless link (other than frequency dependent absorption in the atmosphere), provided that
    there is only one propagation path between TX and RX units. This can only be achieved by
    ensuring that there are <font color="#0080FF">no reflections</font> of the transmitted
    signal arriving within the 'aperture' of the receiver. One of the few examples where this
    holds true is for satellite to ground communications where the receiving antenna is a very
    focused parabolic reflector pointing directly towards the satellite and there are no
    objects (other than distant planets!) from which a reflection can arise. </h4>
