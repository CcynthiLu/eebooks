<h2>Frequency flat vs frequency selective fading</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>A challenging phenomenon of multipath propagation is that the degree
    of cancellation or reinforcement of signals changes for the different frequencies within a
    data signal. This is because the relative phase shift between two frequency components
    undergoing identical path delays will be different as the wavelength of the two components
    is altered. The effect is known as <font color="#0080FF">frequency selective fading</font>
    and gives rise to notches in the frequency response of the channel.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>If the path lengths for all the signals are very similar compared to
    the wavelengths of the signal components, then the phase variations between components
    will be small and they will all undergo very similar amounts of reinforcement or
    cancellation. This is often termed <font color="#0080FF">flat fading</font>. On the other
    hand, if the difference in path length, is large the fading characteristics will vary
    greatly even with small frequency separations.<br>
    <br>
    The degree of correlation between fading over a range of frequencies is expressed in terms
    of the <font color="#0080FF">coherence bandwidth</font> which is defined as the bandwidth
    over which the fading statistics are correlated to better than 90%. </h4>
