<h2>Characteristics of noise</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Noise is usually classified as <font color="#0080FF">white</font> or <font color="#0080FF">coloured</font> depending on the spectral density of the noise power with
    frequency. <br>
    <br>
    White Noise is defined as having a flat power spectral density over all frequencies of
    interest, with a value usually denoted as <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> Watts/Hz.</h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>Coloured noise has a non-uniform spectral distribution; however, over
    a finite bandwidth corresponding perhaps to a single communications channel, the power
    spectral density might appear flat, hence the term <font color="#0080FF">bandlimited white
    Gaussian noise</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i>.</i></font> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Not only is it necessary for the spectrum to be flat, but the statistics of the noise must
    be such that the envelope distribution of the bandlimited noise must be <font color="#0080FF">Gaussian</font> in nature to fully satisfy the <a "" href="../ch2/c2s4p5.htm">Shannon condition</a>. Fortunately this holds approximately true
    for the majority of practical narrowband communications systems. </h4>
