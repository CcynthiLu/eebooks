<h1>4.4 The telephone channel </h1>

<h2>AC coupled channels</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In the discussions so far, we have assumed that the channel is able to
    pass all frequency components of a data signal from 0&nbsp;Hz up to a bandwidth of <i>B</i>&nbsp;Hz. There
    are, however, many communications channels that are not able to pass low frequency
    components, either because they need to be <font COLOR="#0080FF">ac-coupled</font>
    for practical reasons (such as eliminating unwanted dc-offsets), or because the bandwidth
    allocated to a given user is in a part of the spectrum well removed from 0&nbsp;Hz, for
    example, wireless communications. </h4>
    <h4>The domestic telephone channel is a classic example of a channel which is <font color="#0080FF">bandpass</font> in nature, that is, it has a low frequency and high
    frequency cut-off in its gain response.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4> The low frequency cut-off (ac-coupling) results from capacitive
    and/or inductive coupling of the telephone line at both the exchange and subscriber ends
    allowing dc power for the telephone to be passed over the same cable as the speech or data
    signal. The high frequency cut-off is a combination of deliberate filtering at the
    exchange to minimize noise on the channel and also the <a "" href="c4s2p3.htm">transmission
    line filtering effect</a> of long lengths of cable. <br>
    <br>
    A typical telephone channel response is shown here. Notice that even within the channel,
    the gain response may not be flat and this in itself will introduce further symbol
    degradation. </h4>
