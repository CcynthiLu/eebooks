<h2>Doppler shift</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The Doppler shift introduced into a signal between
transmitter and receiver units, or moving reflectors, is a function of their relative
motion, the angle of arrival of the signal, and the operating frequency or wavelength.
These parameters are related as follows:<br>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doppler shift&nbsp;(Hz) =&nbsp;<i>v.f</i>.cos(<i>x</i>)&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>c</i><BR>
<BR>
where <i>v</i> is the relative speed of transmitter and
receiver units in m/s, <i>f</i> is the carrier frequency in Hz, <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s 
and <i>x</i> is the relative angle of arrival in degrees.<br>
<BR>
For example, the Doppler shift experienced by a
cellular phone within a car travelling at 70&nbsp;mph directly away from a base-station
transmitter, operating on the DCS1800 system (carrier frequency 1.8&nbsp;GHz) is 189&nbsp;Hz.
The Doppler shift for a person walking along the street at 4&nbsp;mph is, however, much smaller
at only 11&nbsp;Hz.<br><BR>

A typical spectrum of a signal received at a mobile
terminal when moving within a multipath environment with several reflectors each giving
different angles of arrival and hence different Doppler shift is shown below. The source
was a single tone at the carrier frequency. </h4>
