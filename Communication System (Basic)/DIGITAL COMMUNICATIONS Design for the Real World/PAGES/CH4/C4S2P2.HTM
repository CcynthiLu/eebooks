<h2>Gain distortion &#150; amplifiers</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">

    <td width="50%"><h4>Amplifiers, particularly RF power amplifiers in radio systems and
    higher power lasers in optical systems, do not exhibit a linear relationship between input
    power and output power, often owing to <font color="#0080FF">gain compression</font> in
    the devices used.<br>
    <br>
    The effect on digital signals passing through these non-linear devices is twofold.
    Firstly, the careful pulse shaping achieved with a Nyquist filter can be corrupted,
    reintroducing <a HREF="../Ch3/C3s2p1.htm">intersymbol interference</a> into the link.
    Secondly, the non-linearity can result in what is commonly termed <font color="#0080FF">spectral
    regrowth</font> due to <font color="#0080FF">intermodulation products</font> being
    generated within devices.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>In many applications, particularly digital cellular systems, spectral
    regrowth is a major problem and a lot of design effort is focused on compensating for this
    problem, either by <font color="#0080FF">linearizing</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>the
    components (see <a CLASS="popup" HREF="javascript:open_indepth_window(1)">in-depth</a>), or by selecting modulation formats such as <a "" href="../ch5/c5s3p6.htm">GMSK</a> that are particularly tolerant to amplitude
    non-linearity.<br>
    <br>
    In fact most components, mixers, op-amps, couplers, and so on are not perfectly linear and
    hence introduce amplitude distortion; however, the distortion is usually much less than
    that introduced by the higher power or active RF components within a system. </h4>
