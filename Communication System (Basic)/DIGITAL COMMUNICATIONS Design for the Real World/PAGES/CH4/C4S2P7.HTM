    <td width="100%"><h4>In optical fibre links, distortion is usually attributed to time
    dispersion in the fibre, which gives rise to an upper limit on the data rate that can be
    supported. The time dispersion, which is caused by rays passing through the fibre with
    different numbers of reflections (called <font color="#0080FF">multi-mode propagation</font>),
    is most effectively dealt with by using a single or <font color="#0080FF">mono-mode fibre</font>
    and corresponding laser source, although these are more costly to manufacture.<br>
    <br>
    In the wireless channel, phase distortion is not a problem for signals travelling along
    any individual path between source and receiver. In applications where the signal travels
    by multiple paths, however, each of which may have a different path length and hence
    relative time delay, the phases of the components making up the composite received signal
    will all be different. This can create significant problems for data signals as discussed
    in <a href="c4s5p1.htm">Section 4.5</a>. </h4>
