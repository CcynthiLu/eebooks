    <td width="50%"><h4>In order to allow unmodulated data symbols to pass uncorrupted through
    ac-coupled channels, it is necessary to ensure that the symbol stream has very little or
    no energy at or near 0&nbsp;Hz. This means that&nbsp; the data must be either<font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font><font color="#0080FF">scrambled</font> or <font color="#0080FF">encoded</font> to ensure that no long strings of 1s or 0s are transmitted.

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>Scrambling of the data involves <i>reordering </i>of the data symbols
    in such a way that the chances of long strings of 1s or 0s occurring in the scrambled
    waveform is minimized or eliminated. This process introduces a processing overhead and
    also a latency in the encoding and decoding process which may introduce unacceptable time
    delay in the communication process &#150; particularly if digital voice is being carried. In
    most cases, a data encoding process is used in preference to scrambling, albeit at the
    expense of occupied bandwidth in most cases. There are many data encoding schemes for
    reducing the dc content of a data signal, the most common of which is <font color="#0080FF">Manchester encoding</font>. It can be seen that compared with the original
    <font color="#0080FF">non-return-to-zero (NRZ)</font> data stream, the Manchester encoded
    signal never contains long strings of 1s or 0s.<br>
