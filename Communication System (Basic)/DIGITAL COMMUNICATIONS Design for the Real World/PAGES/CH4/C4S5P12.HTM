<h2>How propagation changes with operating frequency</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>The way in which signals propagate though the air varies with the
    frequency or wavelength. Some microwave frequencies for example are heavily attenuated by
    water droplets or oxygen molecules in the atmosphere when the size of these particles
    becomes comparable with the signal wavelength, (60&nbsp;GHz for water molecule absorbtion). </h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>In contrast, at very low operating frequencies (&lt;30&nbsp;MHz) where the
    wavelength is very large, radio signals can propagate extremely long distances (in fact
    around the earth) owing to the various layers within the ionosphere acting as giant wave
    guides reflecting the signal to and fro between the layers. Unfortunately the properties
    of the ionospheric layers change with time of day, season, temperature, and so on,
    and the propagation characteristics can be very unpredictable and data
    transmission rates are often limited to a few kbps. Above 30&nbsp;MHz, ionospheric reflection
    begins to pack up and propagation is principally by line-of-sight path. In order to
    communicate over long distances, high antenna towers are required to combat the curvature
    of the earth. </h4>
