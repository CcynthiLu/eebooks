<h2>Coping with multipath fading</h2>

<h3>Spectral spreading</h3>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="66%"><h4>Two alternative methods exist for coping with both flat and frequency
    selective fading both involve increasing the bandwidth required to send the data.<br>
    <br>
    A technique known as <a "" href="../ch8/c8s4p4.htm">direct sequence spread spectrum</a>
    uses a wideband data sequence to mix with a narrowband data signal and thence <font color="#0080FF">spread</font> the energy well outside the coherence bandwidth for the
    channel. A small proportion of the spread signal energy will be lost in the frequency
    selective fades, but the majority will pass with little distortion through the channel. By
    <font COLOR="#0080FF">de-spreading</font> the signal in the receiver, a reasonable
    copy of the original transmitted signal can be obtained. Data coding and channel
    equalization are often employed in addition to the spreading to improve the integrity of
    the channel.</h4>

    <td width="67%"><h4> Instead of spreading the data signal instantaneously (and thinly)
    over a wide frequency range, an equally effective method is to rapidly change the position
    of the narrow data signal within a much wider bandwidth. This <a "" href="../ch8/c8s4p2.htm">frequency hopping</a> approach means that for some of the time
    the signal will fall within a selective fade, but for most of the time, it will be passed
    within a non-fading portion of the channel. The result, as for direct sequence spreading,
    is that most of the data signal most of the time reaches the receiver with little
    distortion, and with extra coding a high integrity communications link can be established.
