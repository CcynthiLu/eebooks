    the data integrity is not compromised when some of the parallel channels fall within the
    fading notches (remember these notches change position with time as the user moves), then
    it is possible to do away with the reference signals and simply rely on sufficient of the
    parallel channels being decoded correctly to allow the receiver to correct for any data
    errors in the few faded sub-channels.</h4>
