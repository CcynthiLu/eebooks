<h2>Dealing with interference</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Because most interference (excluding noise) in communications systems
    is generated by other items of equipment, it is often possible with<font color="#0080FF">
    good design</font> to minimize the effects of interference. This can be achieved both by
    judicious selection of modulation and coding format to be the least sensitive to a given
    type of interference, and also by tackling the causes of the interference.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Crosstalk</font> in telephone lines, for example, can be reduced by careful layout of
    cables, or by replacing cables with optical fibre, which has no external radiation to
    cause crosstalk.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#0080FF">Ghosting</font> caused by multipath can often be cured by using directive antennas to
    avoid picking up reflections. Some modern cellular base-stations and even some mobile
    handsets are using <font color="#0080FF">adaptive antennas </font> which in real time
    change the direction of the antenna beam to <font color="#0080FF">null out</font>
    interferers and <font color="#0080FF">focus</font> on the wanted signal. </h4>
    <h4><font color="#0080FF">Co-channel and adjacent channel interference</font> is again controllable by good
    system planning and good selective filtering within the receiver modem. </h4>
