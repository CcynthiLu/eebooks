<h1>2.4 Calculation of channel capacity </h1>
<!--Body Text Here-->

<h2>Limitation due to finite bandwidth</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In order to determine the maximum rate at which data can be sent
    over a channel, we need to know the maximum symbol rate that can be supported in a channel
    as a function of the channel bandwidth. <br>
    <br>
    For the moment, let us consider only 'lowpass' or 'baseband' channels where we can assume
    that the channel can pass signals with frequencies within the range 0 Hz to <i>B</i> Hz.
    This is called the <font color="#0080FF">channel passband</font>.</h4>
    <h4>Shown here is an example of an 8-ary symbol stream which just happens to begin to
    alternate between the maximum and minimum voltage levels. This looks like a square wave,
    for which the harmonic structure is known from its <a HREF="../ch1/C1s1p3.htm">Fourier
    series</a> expansion. The fundamental of this square-wave is at a frequency of 0.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;1/<i>T<sub>s</sub></i>,
    where <i>T<sub>s</sub></i> is the symbol period. </h4>
