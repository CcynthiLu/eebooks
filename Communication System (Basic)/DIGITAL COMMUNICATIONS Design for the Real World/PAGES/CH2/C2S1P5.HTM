<h2>Commercial realities</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>The reality of the communications market-place is that cost and
    appearance mean much more to the consumer than the technology inside. Mobile phones sell
    on their style and talk time, rather than their receiver sensitivity
    or bit error rate performance. </h4>
    <h4>This is an important lesson for engineers to grasp, for although some mobile phones
    are indeed much better technically than others, all are simply assumed by the customer to
    work properly, and achieving technical excellence may not lead to excellent sales.<br>
    <br>
    It is a difficult and challenging task to design a product that meets the expectations and
    needs without <font color="#0080FF">over-engineering</font> or <font color="#0080FF">under-engineering</font>
    and all the cost, timescale and reliability issues that follow. It is hoped that this book
    will provide a good grasp of the design choices available to the digital communications
    engineer, from which a correctly engineered product can be achieved. </h4>
