    <td width="100%"><h3>Power consumption </h3>
    <h4>The power consumption/performance trade-off is almost always a consideration for
    engineers, especially if the equipment is to be battery powered. Using the same example of
    cellular handset power amplifiers, the problem is not only to achieve linearity in the
    amplifier, but to do so with sensible power efficiency. At present, approximately half of
    the power drawn from the battery in a handset is wasted in heat in the RF amplifier. </h4>

    <h4> Sizes of electronic components are of course diminishing, but so is the space into
    which engineers are expected to squeeze very complex circuitry. Complete wireless data
    modems are beginning to appear conforming to the now familiar <font color="#0080FF">PCMCIA</font>
    'credit card' format for computer peripherals. Here, the problem is not only how to fit
    radio frequency and digital processing into such a small space, but also how to
    accommodate a decent aerial! </h4>
