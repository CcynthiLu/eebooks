    <td width="50%"><h4>Chapter 2 is all about identifying the factors which are going to
    dominate in the early stages of a digital communications system design. Without a good
    understanding of the 'big issues' of bandwidth and noise in dictating data throughput and
    modem complexity, the more detailed issues of modulation type, hardware implementation and
    performance optimization, covered in the later chapters, will not fit into place.</h4>
    <h4>
    Most of the discussion centres on the engineering aspects and how they influence system
    design however the first section covers issues which <font color="#0080FF">fall outside
    the control of the engineer</font>, such as regulatory or commercial pressures, yet which
    often have a significant part to play in dictating the final engineering solution. </h4>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4><a href="c2s2p1.htm">Section 2.2</a> begins to unravel how channel
    bandwidth and system noise dominate the performance of all digital communication systems,
    demonstrating that the designer is always faced with a trade-off between the two. <a href="c2s3p1.htm">Section 2.3</a> takes us quickly away from binary signals of 1s and 0s
    to multi-level modulation, where the signal on the channel can represent a single bit or
    thousands of bits at any one time, as the designer chooses. Finally, <a href="c2s4p1.htm">Section
    2.4</a> ties up the loose ends of the by-now-familiar noise and bandwidth debate,
    introducing the theoretical optimum performance for a digital communications link as
    defined in the Shannon bound. </h4>
