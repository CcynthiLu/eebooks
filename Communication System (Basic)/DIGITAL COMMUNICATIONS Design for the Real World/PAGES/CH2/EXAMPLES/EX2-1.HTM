<h2>Example 2.1</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">A modem claims to operate with a bandwidth
efficiency of 5&nbsp;bits/second/Hz when using 1024&nbsp;symbol states in the transmission constellation.

<OL TYPE="a">
<li class="paddedlist">How many bits are being encoded in to each
symbol, and what is the modem capacity if the baud rate is 4000&nbsp;symbols/second?</li>

<li class="paddedlist">How many symbol states must be employed if
the user wishes to send his information in half the time?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<OL type="a">
<li class="paddedlist">For 1024&nbsp;symbol states, the number of bits
represented by each symbol is log<sub>2</sub>1024 =&nbsp;10&nbsp;bits/symbol.<br>
<BR>
For a baud rate of 4000, this means that the
  information transfer rate is 4000&nbsp;x&nbsp;10 =&nbsp;40&nbsp;kbps.</li>

<li class="paddedlist">In order to send the information in half the
time, it would be necessary to send data at 80&nbsp;kbps and hence to encode 20&nbsp;bits in each
symbol. The number of symbol states is thus a massive 2<sup>20</sup> =&nbsp;1048576.</li>
