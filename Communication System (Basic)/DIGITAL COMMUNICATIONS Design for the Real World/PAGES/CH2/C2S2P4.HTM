<h2>Multi-level symbol operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In principle we can use any number of symbols (symbol states) for
    conveying digital information. For example, why not use 1024 different voltage states,
    each state (symbol) conveying <font color="#0080FF">log<sub>2</sub>1024&nbsp;=&nbsp;10bits</font>. We
    could even consider using 1048576 symbol states, with each symbol conveying 20 bits of
    information! <br>
    <br>
    Clearly there is a practical limit on the number of states to be used, governed by the
    ability of the receiving equipment to <font color="#0080FF">accurately resolve</font> the
    individual states (voltage levels, frequencies, light intensities, and so on). This will
    be determined principally by the levels of <font color="#0080FF">noise and distortion</font>
    introduced by the channel and by the TX and RX units.<br>
    <br>
    For example, some of the more recent telephone modems operating at 56 kbps use in excess
    of 1024 different symbol states (combinations of amplitude and phase of carrier) to signal
    over the telephone channel, while the current digital cellular telephone systems use only
    two or four states because the equipment has to operate in much noisier (electrically)
    environments. </h4>
