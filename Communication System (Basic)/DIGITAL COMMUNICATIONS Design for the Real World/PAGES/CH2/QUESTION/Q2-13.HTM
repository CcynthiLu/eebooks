<h2>Question 2.13</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">The serial ports on two computers which use binary
signalling are connected by a twisted pair cable. The cable has a flat frequency response
up to 12&nbsp;kHz, with negligible group delay distortion.<br>
<BR>
<ol type="a">
<li class="paddedlist">What is the maximum information transfer rate
  that can be accommodated by the cable, assuming a noise-free environment?</li>
<li class="paddedlist">If the noise
  introduced by the cable is &#150;40&nbsp;dB with respect to the signal power, what is the
  resulting maximum information transfer rate?</li></ol>
