<h2>QAM detection</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>QAM can be decoded using <font color="#0080FF">coherent</font> or <font color="#0080FF">differentially coherent
    detection</font> just as for PSK systems. We shall&nbsp; concern ourselves here only with
    true coherent detection. Details of differential detection systems can be found in <a href="../ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Proakis1989">Proakis (1989)</a>. Just as for QPSK, a QAM demodulator requires
    the recovery of quadrature carriers in the receiver. Very similar <a "" href="c6s4p3.htm">Nth
    power carrier recovery circuits</a> can be used, although the problem of dealing with <a "" href="../ch5/c5s4p9.htm">phase ambiguity</a> in the recovered carrier is greatly
    complicated by the presence of the amplitude component of the data symbols.<br>

<h4>    The output of each demodulator is a baseband multi-level symbol set. Ideally this should
    undergo <a "" href="../ch3/c3s5p3.htm">matched filtering</a> for optimum performance in
    noise, before being passed through a bank of comparators to determine the level from each
    demodulator at the sampling instant, and hence decode the corresponding bit pattern. </h4>
