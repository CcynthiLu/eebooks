<h1>6.3 M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (M-ary FSK) </h1>

<h2>M-ary FSK application</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>Unlike M-ary ASK and in contrast to many of the discussions to date,
    M-ary FSK is very much of interest for <font color="#0080FF">increasing</font> the noise
    immunity of the modulation format compared with binary FSK, allowing a designer to achieve
    reliable data transmission in the presence of high levels of noise.</h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4> As we shall see shortly, this is only possible by using a set of
    'orthogonal symbols', with precisely spaced frequencies which require large amounts of
    bandwidth. M-ary FSK using orthogonal signalling is one of the few techniques where the
    modem performance approaches the <a "" href="../Ch2/c2s4p6.htm">Shannon bound</a> for

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>It is also possible to operate M-ary FSK with 'non-orthogonal' symbol
    frequencies as we saw with binary FSK. By spacing the frequencies very close together it
    is possible to squeeze four symbols into the space of two symbols, for example, and hence
    improve the bandwidth efficiency over BFSK. In this case, the noise immunity for the M-ary
    FSK system <font color="#0080FF">decreases</font> compared with the binary system, as the
    symbol frequencies are no longer orthogonal. </h4>
