<h1>6.4 M-ary Phase Shift Keying (M-ary PSK) </h1>
<h2>Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>We have already seen in the case of M-ary FSK that an <a "" href="c6s3p2.htm">orthogonal symbol set</a><i> </i>makes it possible to send two or more
    symbols simultaneously over a channel, without their affecting the coherent detection
    performance of any individual symbol. It turns out that as well as the M-ary FSK
    orthogonal symbol set, there is orthogonality between a <font color="#0080FF">cosine</font>
    and <font color="#0080FF">sine</font> carrier term when averaged over a full number of
    carrier cycles. This would imply that if we were to signal using binary PSK on the <font color="#0080FF">cosine</font>
    of a carrier, and <font color="#0080FF">simultaneously</font> send a second PSK signal
    using the <font color="#0080FF">sine</font> of a carrier, then it would be possible to detect each one
    independently of the other, (as if the other were not there), providing that each detector
    averaged over a symbol period that contained a whole number of carrier cycles.</h4>

    We can thus envisage a PSK modulation scheme with four phase states, <font color="#0080FF">0<sup>o</sup></font>,
    <font color="#0080FF">90<sup>o</sup></font>, <font color="#0080FF">180<sup>o</sup></font> and <font color="#0080FF">270<sup>o</sup></font>, 
    which are in phase quadrature
    with each other. This 4-ary PSK scheme is thus called <font color="#0080FF">Quadrature
    Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)</font>. The orthogonality property of QPSK means that it can be
    used to send information at <font color="#0080FF">twice the speed of BPSK </font>in the
    same bandwidth, without compromising the detection performance over BPSK. </h4>
