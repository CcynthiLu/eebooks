<h2><i>Symbol</i> error performance for QPSK</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Many textbooks present results for the <font color="#0080FF">symbol</font>
    error rate for QPSK which indicate a worse performance than for BPSK. This is to be
    expected since the symbol states are closer together. It must be remembered, however, that
    QPSK is conveying <font color="#0080FF">two bits of information for every symbol</font>
    and the likelihood of both bits being detected in error is much smaller than only one bit
    being in error (assuming <a href="../ch3/c3s5p11.htm">Gray coding</a> of the symbol
    states). <br>
    <br>
    Taking this into account, the bit error probability will be less than the symbol
    error probability for QPSK, and as we already know is the same as the bit error rate for
    BPSK.<br>
    <br>
    Because of the good bandwidth efficiency and noise performance, QPSK and its variants are
    currently the most widely used modulation types in both wired and wireless modems. </h4>
