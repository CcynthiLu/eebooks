<h1>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-level digital modulation</h1>
<h1>6.1 Introduction</h1>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>Thus far, we have only considered bandpass data modulation schemes
    using binary signalling, and with only one property (<font color="#0080FF">amplitude</font>, 
<font color="#0080FF">frequency </font>or
<font color="#0080FF">
    phase)</font> of the carrier wave being altered. We have also seen that for binary ASK, FSK
    or PSK, the minimum bandwidth required for transmission is at least twice the minimum
    bandwidth required to pass the baseband binary data stream.<br>
    <br>
    In order to improve on the bandwidth efficiency of bandpass data transmission, we can of
    course increase the number of symbol states used (except for the case of FSK, where
    increasing the number of frequencies can increase the occupied bandwidth). As a general
    rule, however, we know that as the number of symbol states is increased, the tolerance to
    noise is reduced. We shall see that there are two exceptions to this rule, QPSK and
    orthogonal M-ary FSK. </h4>
