    and Phase Keying (M-ary APK)</font> class rather than the QAM subset class. The
    reason for this particular symbol layout is to maximize the phase difference between
    symbols of the <font color="#0080FF">same energy</font> to 90<sup>o</sup> rather than only 37<sup>o</sup>
    for 16-QAM at the expense of increased amplitude levels. This is on the basis that
    there is predominantly phase distortion in a telephone line.</h4>

    Circular QAM constellations are sometimes used in order to alleviate the problems of phase
