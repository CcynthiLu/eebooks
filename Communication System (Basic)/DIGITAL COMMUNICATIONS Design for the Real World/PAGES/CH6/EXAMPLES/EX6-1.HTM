<h2>Example 6.1</h2>
<h4>A digital television system has a source analogue
video signal with bandwidth extending from 0&nbsp;Hz to 2&nbsp;MHz. This signal is sampled at four
times the highest frequency using a 16-bit A/D converter. The resulting data signal is
sent over the air using a 16-QAM modulation format with a roll-off factor on the
pulse-shaping filters of <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5.
What is the bandwidth occupied by the transmitted digital video signal?</h4>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>The sampling rate for the A/D converter is 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;MHz
=&nbsp;8&nbsp;million samples per second. Each sample is encoded as a 16-bit word, resulting in a
bit rate of 16&nbsp;x&nbsp;8&nbsp;million =&nbsp;128&nbsp;Mbps at the converter output.</h4>

<h4>A 16-QAM modulation format conveys four bits per
symbol, and because it is a bandpass format, this equates to a maximum bandwidth
efficiency of 4&nbsp;bits/second/Hz for an ideal (<SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) filter. </h4>

<h4>For <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5, the bandwidth efficiency is reduced by a factor (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>) to 2.66&nbsp;bits/second/Hz, and the bandwidth required
to support a data rate of 128&nbsp;Mbps is 48&nbsp;MHz.</h4>
