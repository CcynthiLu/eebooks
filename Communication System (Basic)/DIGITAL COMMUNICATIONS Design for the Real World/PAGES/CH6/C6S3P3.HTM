<h2>Properties of orthogonal symbols</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>The practical interpretation of the orthogonality definition is that
    if a symbol <i>a<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) is mixed with a carrier reference equal to the
    frequency and phase of a second symbol <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>(<i>t</i>), and the mixer output is
    then averaged over a symbol period using a matched filter or integrator, the output will
    be zero. This means that with orthogonal signalling it is possible to <font color="#0080FF">increase</font> the number of symbol states used without affecting the
    output from an <font color="#0080FF">individual</font> coherent detector, and hence
    without increasing the probability of symbol error for each detector. <br>
    <br>
    As we increase the number of orthogonal symbols used for transmission, we can increase the
    duration of each symbol for a given data information rate, (see <a href="../ch2/c2s3p1.htm">
    section 2.3</a>). The longer the symbol duration, the greater the time for
    averaging each symbol in the receiver and the better the <i>S</i>/<i>N</i> ratio at the
    detector output, improving the probability of correct symbol detection. Orthogonal FSK in
    theory can have any number of orthogonal symbol states, but does so at the expense of
    ever-increasing occupied bandwidth. </h4>
