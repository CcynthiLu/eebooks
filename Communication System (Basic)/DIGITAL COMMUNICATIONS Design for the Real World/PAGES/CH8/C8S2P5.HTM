<h2>Disdvantage of FDMA</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">A disadvantage that has often been levelled at FDM/FDMA is the
    inflexibility to accommodate variable user data rates within a fixed bandwidth frequency
    slot. This claim is nowadays unfounded for two reasons. Firstly, it is practical to vary
    the data rate in a given frequency slot by increasing the number of symbol states used.
    Secondly, it is possible to assign a user more than one frequency slot, or introduce the
    concept of a variable bandwidth slot in order to vary the user data rate. Both of these
    solutions rely heavily on the advent of powerful digital signal processing devices that
    can implement adaptive rate multi-symbol modems (these are now commonplace in line modem
    cards), and variable bandwidth matched channel filters &#150; again a simple function for
    today's DSP devices.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Frequency stability and the need for guard-bands has traditionally been a
    bigger problem for FDMA use, requiring very costly and high stability oscillators in the
    modems if the guard-bands are to be kept to a minimum. In recent years, the use of a
    broadcast <font color="#0080FF">off-air</font> reference has been exploited to allow
    designers to dispense with these costly oscillator components and achieve much greater
    stability than hither too possible. (Today, it is possible to buy watches that take their
    timing reference 'off-air' for millisecond precision accuracy.) The major disadvantage of
    FDMA in a wireless environment is the susceptibility of any individual narrow frequency
    slot to <a "" href="../ch4/c4s5p4.htm">frequency selective fading</a> which can cause loss
    of signal for that user &#150; usually on a temporary basis. </td>
