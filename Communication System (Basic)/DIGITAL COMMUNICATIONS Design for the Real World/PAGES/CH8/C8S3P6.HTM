<h2>Disadvantages of TDMA operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">One of the more challenging aspects of TDM/TDMA operation is the
    establishment of <font color="#0080FF">system timing</font> in order to ensure correct
    time slot arrival and framing and to cope with variable path delays in the wireless
    systems. While these can be accommodated by careful design, for small multi-user
    communication systems, the overhead of system timing may favour the use of FDMA methods.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">TDMA use also requires each user terminal to support a much higher data
    rate than the user information rate. This implies faster processing for modulation and
    demodulation, wider bandwidth in the TX/RX section and in particular requires a higher
    peak power rating for the power amplifier in a wireless application compared with an FDMA
    solution. (Assuming equal symbol average energy for both systems to achieve equivalent
    range, the symbol duration for the TDMA system must be much shorter than the FDMA
    equivalent and hence the transmitted symbol power for TDMA must be correspondingly higher
    than for FDMA. Note: the average symbol power and hence average battery drain for both
    systems are identical.) </td>
