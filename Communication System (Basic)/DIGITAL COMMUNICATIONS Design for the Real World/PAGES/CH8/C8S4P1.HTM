    systems have been used almost exclusively by the military as a means of operating covert
    radio communications in the presence of high levels of interference. In recent years, the
    interference immunity of CDMA for multi-user communications, together with its very good <font color="#0080FF">spectral efficiency</font> characteristics, has been seen to offer
    distinct advantages for public cellular-type communications. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">There are two very distinct types of CDMA system,classified as <font color="#0080FF">direct sequence</font> CDMA and <font color="#0080FF">frequency hopping</font>
    CDMA. Both of these systems involve transmission bandwidths that are many times that
    required by an individual user, with the energy of each user's signal<i> </i><font color="#0080FF">spread</font> with time throughout this wide channel. Consequently these
    techniques are often referred to as <font color="#0080FF">spread spectrum</font> systems.
    One of the most prominent proponents of CDMA in the cellular market is Andrew Viterbi, and
    his book on the subject (<a href="../Ch10/c10s1p1.htm#Viterbi1997">Viterbi, 1997</a>) is well worth reading. </td>
