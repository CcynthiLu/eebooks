<h2>Frequency hopped CDMA</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><font color="#0080FF">Frequency hopping</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>involves
    taking the narrow bandpass signals for individual users and constantly changing their
    positions in frequency with time. In a frequency selective fading environment, the benefit
    of changing frequency like this is to ensure that any one user's signal will not remain
    within a fade for any prolonged period of time. Clearly for frequency hopping to be
    effective, the users must hop over a bandwidth significantly wider than <font color="#0080FF">notch</font> caused by <a href="../ch4/c4s5p4.htm">frequency selective
    fading</a>. In order to ensure that individual users never (or rarely) hop onto the same
    frequency slot at the same time, causing mutual interference, the carrier frequencies are
    assigned according to a predetermined sequence or <font color="#0080FF">code</font>.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Frequency hopping is most effective if a fast hopping rate is used
    (several thousand times per second) so that the communications are not corrupted by fading
    or mutual interference for any length of time. This, however, brings problems in the
    design of fast switching synthesizers and broadband power amplifiers which in practice put
    an upper limit on the hopping rate. Also, the narrowband channels are susceptible to <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p10.htm">Doppler shift</a>, <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p9.htm">local
    oscillator error</a> and so on, and compensation techniques are struggling with fast hop
    rates. Hopping also makes a system less vulnerable to discrete narrowband interference and
    near-far effect problems. </td>
