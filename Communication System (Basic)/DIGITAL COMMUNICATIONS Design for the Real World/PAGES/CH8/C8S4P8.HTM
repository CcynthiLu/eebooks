<h2>Advantages of CDMA</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Spreading the user signal well beyond the frequency selective fading
    bandwidth is clearly advantageous for coping with this unique problem in wireless
    communications. It also provides protection from narrowband interfering signals (these are
    spread by the 'de-spreading' process in a direct sequence CDMA receiver).<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps the main advantage of CDMA as a multi-user system is the <font color="#0080FF">flexibility
    to accommodate variable user data capacity</font>. Each user in a spread spectrum CDMA
    system can increase their modulation rate and local narrowband modulation bandwidth
    without affecting other users when it is spread, as long as the user does not increase the
    overall wideband energy of the composite multi-user signal and hence increase the chance
    of mutual interference when de-spreading beyond that tolerable to the system.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">By slightly over-subscribing the number of users and their 'spread energy
    quota' on a spread spectrum CDMA system, it is possible for an operator to exploit the
    fact that any individual user will not be using the 'corporate' channel all of the time,
    and provided that the transmitter is powered down when the user is not speaking, for
    example, the average overall energy will be at the acceptable 'under-subscribed' level. </td>
