<h2>Example of a TDMA system (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The GSM frame format is such that eight users are assigned to the same
    transmission frequency, and hence eight time slots are provided in each frame, to be
    repeated regularly in subsequent frames. Each user must transmit information at a rate of <font color="#0080FF">270&nbsp;kbps</font> within the <font color="#0080FF">200&nbsp;kHz</font> bandwidth
    allowed (<a "" href="../ch5/c5s3p6.htm">GMSK</a> is used), even though the individual user
    data rate from the voice coder is only 13&nbsp;kbps.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The throughput of each modem is thus much higher than required to support the users' data,
    and hence one could expect the design to be much more complicated and costly than an FDMA
    equivalent. This need not be the case, however, if proper advantage is taken of the fact
    that the data can be stored and processed 'at leisure' over the seven remaining time slots
    as well as during the arrival time slot. </td>
