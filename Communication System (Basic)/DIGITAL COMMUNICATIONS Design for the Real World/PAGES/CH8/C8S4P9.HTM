<h2>Disadvantages of CDMA</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Wideband spreading of signals, whether it be with 'frequency hopping' or
    'direct sequence' techniques, has a penalty in terms of the signal processing overhead
    involved with such high rate and bandwidth transmission. Power control has also been
    identified as a critical issue in maximizing the number of users that can be supported on
    a given common frequency channel.<br>
    <br>
    CDMA also requires a large amount of bandwidth to be available in a contiguous block
    (spread spectrum only) in order to ensure that sufficient spreading can be obtained to
    mitigate the frequency selective fading and to ensure that there is sufficient <font
    color="#0080FF">coding gain</font> in the system. Typically bandwidths of 5&nbsp;MHz upwards
    are desirable for best communications performance in a typical cellular environment,
    although regulatory constraints have forced smaller bandwidths (1.25&nbsp;MHz for IS-95) to be
    used in some circumstances.<br>
