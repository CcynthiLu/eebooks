    <td width="100%">The most widely adopted CDMA radio system (outside the military), was
    pioneered by QUALCOM, a California-based company, and is now embodied in the <A CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.cdg.org">IS-95 standard</a> for cellular telephone applications. This 'air
    interface' is a direct sequence CDMA design, spreading each user voice or data signal over
    a 1.25&nbsp;MHz channel bandwidth.<BR>
    <BR>The maximum user data rate per spreading code is 9600&nbsp;bps, (rates of
    1200, 2400 and 4800 are also possible), which is then channel coded up to 19200&nbsp;bps in the
    forward channel (base to mobile), and 28800&nbsp;bps in the reverse channel (mobile to base).<br>
    <br>
    In the reverse channel, the 28.8&nbsp;kps coded data is mapped onto 64&nbsp;orthogonal symbol states
    known as <font color="#0080FF">WALSH functions</font>, giving a symbol rate of 4800&nbsp;symbol/second. 
    This narrowband symbol stream is then spread using a unique identifying
    spreading code for every mobile unit &#150; called the long code, clocking at a rate of 1.2288&nbsp;million chips/second. 
    The long code is a pseudo-random sequence of length 2<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;1&nbsp;bits. 
    This means that there are <font color="#0080FF">2<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;1 =&nbsp;4398046511103</font> possible different
    code sequences, enough for all the mobiles in the world! </td>
