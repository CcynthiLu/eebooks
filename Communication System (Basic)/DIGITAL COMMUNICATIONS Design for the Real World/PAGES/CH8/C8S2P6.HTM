    <td width="100%">In optical fibre communications, it has been very difficult until
    recently to generate and detect individual carrier frequencies of light with sufficient
    spectral stability to be sandwiched within the finite bandwidth available on long lengths
    of fibre and still resolved at the receiver. Recently, however, the laser source, repeater
    amplifier and detector technology have all improved to permit several independently
    modulated light carriers to be sent over a single fibre. In optical circles, this is
    referred to as <font color="#0080FF">Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)</font><font color="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>rather than frequency division multiplexing.<br>
    <br>
    Each individual light carrier would typically be supporting data rates of up to <font color="#0080FF">10&nbsp;Gbps</font>
    with users <font color="#0080FF">time multiplexed</font> onto the channel. WDM thus offers
    the possibility of several hundreds of gigabits transmission over a single fibre and also
    bi-direction transmission over the same fibre. </td>
