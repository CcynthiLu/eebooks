<h1>8.2 Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) </h1>
<!--Section Heading-->

<h2>Basic system operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Used extensively in the early telephone and wireless multi-user
    communication systems, <font color="#0080FF">frequency division multiplexing</font> of
    users is perhaps the most intuitive form of resource sharing.<br>
    <br>
    If a channel, such as a cable, has a transmission bandwidth <i>W</i>&nbsp;Hz, and individual
    users require <i>B</i>&nbsp;Hz to achieve their required information rate, then the channel in
    theory should be able to support <i>W</i>/<i>B</i> users simultaneously by using bandpass
    modulation, and placing each user in an adjacent slot of the available bandwidth.
    Immediately, we see that the efficiency of frequency multiplexing is governed by how
    effectively the transmission bandwidth is constrained by each user (the value of alpha in
    the root raised cosine filter, for example). It is also dependent on how good (selective)
    the 'de-multiplexing' system is at filtering out the modulation corresponding to each
    user.</td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">With frequency division multiplexing, the data rate and hence modem
    design for each user remains unchanged by the requirement to operate a multi-user system,
    and the only additional circuitry is for frequency conversion to the assigned slot. The
    user will typically be assigned the frequency slot for the duration of the message. </td>
