<h2>Advantages of TDMA Operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">An often quoted advantage of TDMA operation is the ease with which users
    can be given variable data rate services by simply assigning them multiple time slots. For
    example, a GSM user could be given all eight time slots within a frame, giving a total
    fully coded user data rate of <font color="#0080FF">8&nbsp;x&nbsp;9600&nbsp;bps =&nbsp;76800&nbsp;bps</font>. 
    (This assumes that the
    users' equipment has sufficient processing power to process all eight time slots
    simultaneously.) This facility has its dual in assigning multiple frequency slots in an
    FDMA system, however, this is perceived to require more complex hardware for
    implementation. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">A second advantage of TDMA is the commonality in the base-station of the
    transmitting hardware for all time slot users. There is only one power amplifier required
    to support multiple users (albeit with a wider modulation bandwidth). Traditionally with
    FDMA, each user channel at the base-station has required an individual power amplifier,
    the output of which is combined at high power to feed a single common antenna. The advent
    of <a href="../ch4/c4s2p2.htm">multi-carrier linear power amplifiers</a> in the
    last few years has begun to alter this TDMA/FDMA bias.<br>
    <br>
    For packet-based applications, TDM/TDMA operation is clearly a well-matched access method.
