<h1>8.3 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) </h1>
<!--Section Heading-->
<!--proofed by DR 6/6-->

<h2>Basic system operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The basic principle behind <font color="#0080FF">time division
    multiplexing</font> is that the user has access to a modem operating at a rate <font color="#0080FF">several times</font> that required to support his own data throughput,
    such that he can send his information in a time slot that is shorter than his own message
    transaction. Other users can then be assigned similar time slots on the same channel.
    Clearly if the data rate on the channel is <i>w</i>&nbsp;bits/second, and each individual user
    requires only <i>b</i>&nbsp;bits/second, then the system can support <i>w/b</i>&nbsp;simultaneous
    users.<br>
    <br>
    In many TDM systems, users are assigned a time slot for the duration of their call whether
    they require it or not. So, for example, if the user is generating voice traffic, or
    typing at a keyboard, a time slot will be assigned regularly regardless of whether the
    person is speaking or a key has been pressed, and it is very likely that the channel
    capacity is being 'wasted' (this is equally true of FDMA systems).<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">In order to maximize the use of a channel resource under these
    circumstances, <a "" href="../ch1/c1s3p8.htm">packet based transmission</a> is now common
    on wired links, where the user is not given a fixed repeated time slot, but rather
    allocated a time slot 'on demand'. This system works well provided time slot availability
    can be guaranteed for real-time applications &#150; video, voice, and so on. It also involves
    quite a high penalty in signalling overheads. </td>
