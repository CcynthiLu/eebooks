<h2>8.1 Introduction to Chapter 8</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">For the majority of data communications that take place, there is a
    requirement for several users to <font color="#0080FF">share a common channel</font>
    resource at the same time. This resource could be the high speed optical fibre links
    between continents, the frequency spectrum in a cellular telephone system, or the twisted
    pair 'ethernet' cable in the office.<br>
    <br>
    For multiple users to be able to share a common resource in a managed and effective way
    requires some form of <font color="#0080FF">access protocol</font> that defines when or
    how the sharing is to take place and the means by which messages from individual users are
    to be identified upon receipt. This sharing process has come to be known as <font color="#0080FF">multiplexing</font> in wired communication systems, and <font color="#0080FF">multiple access</font> in wireless digital communications.<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Three classes of multi-user access techniques will be considered in this
    chapter: techniques where individual users are identified by assigning different <font color="#0080FF">frequency</font>
    slots, techniques where users are given different <font color="#0080FF">time</font> slots, and techniques where
    users are given the same time and general frequency slots, and are identified by different
    <font color="#0080FF">codes</font>. We have already touched upon time-based multiplexing techniques when looking
    at packet transmission in the section on the <a "" href="../ch1/c1s3p1.htm">fundamentals
    of data networks and protocols</a> in Chapter 1. </td>
