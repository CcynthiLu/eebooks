<h2>Wireless FDMA operation</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">FDMA is widely used in wireless communications systems where the radio
    environment creates several challenges for any multiple access method owing to the
    unpredictable and time varying nature of the communications channel.<br>
    <br>
    One of the biggest challenges is the very large variations in received signal power that
    arise from users in different frequency slots due to the so-called <font color="#0080FF">near-far</font>
    effect. A radio user that is very near to a base-station receiver will produce a much
    stronger signal than that from a distant (far) user operating on the extreme of the
    communication range. Typical variations in power can be up to 100&nbsp;dB. If the strong signal
    is producing any out-of-band radiation in&nbsp; the slot occupied by the weak signal, this
    can easily swamp the weak signal corrupting the communications. Much of the discussion in
    this book on controlling the bandwidth and side-lobe energy of digital modulation formats,
    such as<i> </i><a "" href="../ch5/c5s3p5.htm">CPFSK</a>, and on designing modulation
    formats that are not overly sensitive to amplifier distortion, such as <a "" href="../ch6/c6s4p8.htm"><SPAN CLASS=greek>p</SPAN>/4 QPSK</a>, are all driven by this near-far problem in the
    wireless application. </td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">Other challenges in the radio environment include dealing with the
    frequency uncertainty for any individual user caused by <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p10.htm">Doppler
    shift</a> and <a "" href="../ch4/c4s2p9.htm">local oscillator error</a>. This inevitable
    error requires <font color="#0080FF">guard-bands</font><font COLOR="#8080FF"><i> </i></font>to
    be allocated between frequency slots, thus sacrificing some of the efficiency of the FDMA
    scheme. </td>
