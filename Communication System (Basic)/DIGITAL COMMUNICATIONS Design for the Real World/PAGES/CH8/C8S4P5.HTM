<h2>Direct sequence CDMA (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Multi-user operation is achieved in direct sequence CDMA by assigning each
    user a different spreading code or a different time alignment of a common spreading code.
    Only that portion of the wideband spectral energy that has been spread by the same code as
    used in the receiver will be detected. Users are thus able to coexist in the same
    bandwidth and time space on the channel.<br>
    <br>
    Like frequency hopping, spread spectrum CDMA overcomes the problem of frequency selective
    fading by ensuring that most of the spread signal energy falls outside the fading
    'notches'.<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">If there is some correlation between spreading codes, as is almost always
    the case, then there will be a small contribution to any individual de-spread user signal
    from all the other spread users on the channel. Ultimately this puts an upper limit on the
    number of users that can co-locate on the same piece of spectrum before the unwanted
    de-spread energy gives rise to unacceptable data errors. This interference factor also
    gives rise to one of the most stringent <font color="#0080FF">power control</font>
    requirements of all access techniques, as it is clear that this mutual interference
    between users will be minimized for each user if they all operate to give an identical
    spread power level at the receiving site. </td>
