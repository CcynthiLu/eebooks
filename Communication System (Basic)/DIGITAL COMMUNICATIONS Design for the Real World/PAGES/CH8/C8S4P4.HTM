<h2>Direct sequence CDMA</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">In <font color="#0080FF">direct sequence CDMA</font>, the narrowband
    signals from individual users are spread continuously and thinly over a wide bandwidth
    using a <font color="#0080FF">spreading sequence</font>. By mixing the narrowband user
    data signal with a locally generated well-defined wideband signal, the user energy is
    spread to occupy roughly the same bandwidth as the wideband source. The wideband spreading
    signal is generated using a <font color="#0080FF">pseudo-random sequence generator</font>
    (see in-depth) clocked at a very high rate (termed the <font color="#0080FF">chipping rate</font>).

<!--Body Text Here-->

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">De-spreading of the signal is necessary in the receiver in order to
    recover the narrowband user data modulation and this is accomplished by mixing the
    received signal with an identical, accurately timed pseudo-random sequence. This
    correlation process has the effect of reversing the spreading action in the transmitter.
    De-spreading will only occur, however, if the correct sequence is used at both ends of the
    link, and if the two sequences are time aligned (see <a CLASS="popup" HREF="javascript:open_indepth_window(1)">in-depth</a>). </td>
