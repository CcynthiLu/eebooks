<h2>Example of direct sequence CDMA (cont.)</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">The spread baseband sequence in IS-95 must then be modulated onto the
    carrier frequency for transmission. In both the forward and reverse link channels, two
    further second short code PN sequences are superimposed onto identical versions of the
    spread baseband stream, which are then filtered to restrict the signal bandwidth.
    &nbsp; The specification calls for a stop band rejection of better than 40&nbsp;dB at 740&nbsp;kHz. <br>
    <br>
    These two filtered spread baseband data streams form inputs to a <a "" href="../ch6/c6s4p1.htm">QPSK modulator</a>. In the forward path this is a standard QPSK
    approach; however in the reverse link, <a "" href="../ch6/c6s4p9.htm">offset QPSK</a> is
    used, making full use of the non-zero envelope properties of this technique to alleviate
    the design of the handset RF power amplifiers.</td>
