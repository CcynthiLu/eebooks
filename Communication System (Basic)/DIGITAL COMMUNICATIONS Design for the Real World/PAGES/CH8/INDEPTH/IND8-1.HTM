<h2>Pseudo-random sequences</h2>

<h4 CLASS="technical">One of the most common ways of spreading a
CDMA signal is with a pseudo-random noise sequence (often called a PN sequence). This is a
sequence generated by a shift register with feedback (see digaram) which repeats itself
after every <i>N</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup><i>n</i></sup>&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;1 clock cycles. The 3-bit shift register shown would
thus generate a sequence that repeats every seven bits, (often called 'chips' in spread
spectrum applications).<BR>

<h4 CLASS="technical">Of particular interest in CDMA is the auto-correlation of a PN
sequence with itself, and the cross-correlation with other PN sequences generated using
different length shift registers, or registers with different 'taps' from which the
feedback signals are obtained. <BR>
<BR>
<h4 CLASS="technical">The result of <font color="#0080FF">auto-correlation</font> of a PN sequence is shown in
the figure. Auto-correlation is this application involves comparing the similarity of one
sequence with a time displaced version of the same sequence for all possible time offsets
until the sequence repeats itself. A maximum output is achieved only when the two
sequences are exactly time aligned, and falls to a minimum value of 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>N</i> for all sequence
offsets greater than 1&nbsp;chip period. Auto-correlation is achieved practically by mixing the
incoming spread spectrum signal with a locally generated replica of the spreading PN
sequence and sliding the timing of the local PN sequence until a correlation peak is
reached. At this point, the modulation, which has been superimposed on the spreading code
in the transmitter, can be extracted.<br><BR>

<h4 CLASS="technical">If all other spread spectrum signals are operating with unique and
carefully chosen spreading codes, then there will be no <font color="#0080FF">cross-correlation</font> between
them and the contribution from all these other users will also be 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>N</i> times that of
the wanted user correlation peak. Clearly, the larger the sequence length <i>N</i>, the
larger the wanted correlation peak will be with respect to all other signals. This is very
important if a large number of users are to be accommodated on the same frequency and
still allow the de-spreading of any individual signal with sufficient signal to noise
ratio for acceptable communications quality. If the sequence length <i>N</i> is made too
big however, the time taken to find the correlation peak by sliding one sequence against
another can be prohibitively long.</h4>
