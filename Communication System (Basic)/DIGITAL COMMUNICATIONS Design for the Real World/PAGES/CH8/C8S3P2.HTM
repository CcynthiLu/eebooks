<h2>TDMA in a wireless environment</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Just as for FDMA, the wireless environment provides particular challenges
    to TDMA operation. Again, the 'near-far' effect comes into play, with signals from a
    distant user taking longer to arrive at the base-station than those from a near user. In
    order to accommodate these delays, <font color="#0080FF">guard-times</font> are required
    between time slots (cf. frequency guard-bands in FDMA) both to accommodate the variable
    delay between near and far users, and also to allow for timing errors in the start of a
    time slot transmission by any individual user.<br>

<!--Body Text Here-->

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">The near-far problem also gives rise to the same signal strength
    fluctuations in the base-station receiver as identified for FDMA, but in this case there
    is no problem with <a "" href="../ch4/c4s3p1.htm">adjacent channel interference</a> as no
    user is operating concurrently with another. The receiver, is however, required to react
    very rapidly to the changing power level from users in different time slots, and <a "" href="c8s2p3.htm">power control</a> of each user is commonly applied to alleviate this
    problem. </td>
