<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>Given that the Nyquist filter response must apply to the <font color="#0080FF">whole transmission link</font> including TX and RX sections to achieve
    zero ISI performance, it is necessary to consider where best to place the filtering within
    the transmission system. <br>
    <br>
    Filtering is almost always mandatory in the transmission unit, particularly in the case of
    wireless communications, to constrain the <a href="../Ch4/C4s5p1.htm">'on-air
    bandwidth'</a> of the signal to that dictated by <a "" href="../Ch2/C2s1p4.htm">regulation</a>
    or by the practical necessity to co-habit with users on adjacent channel frequencies. Good
    receiver filtering is also vital (again especially in wireless applications), in order to
    remove strong signal interferers from overloading the demodulator circuitry, and also to
    reject as much noise as possible that does not fall within the modulation passband. For
    these reasons, it is necessary for the Nyquist filter function to be shared between TX and
    RX units (assuming that the channel response itself is flat or has been <a "" href="../Ch4/C4s5p9.htm">equalized</a> in some way). <br>

    cosine filter equally between transmitter and receiver so that each unit ends up with what
    is termed a <a "" href="C3s4p1.htm">root raised cosine</a> transfer characteristic. Under
    these circumstances, the peak to mean ratio of the transmitted signal must be evaluated
    for a <font color="#0080FF">root</font> raised cosine response, not a raised cosine response as is often
    mistakenly thought.</h4>
