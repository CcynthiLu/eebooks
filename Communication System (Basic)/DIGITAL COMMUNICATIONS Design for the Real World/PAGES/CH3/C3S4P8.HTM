<h2>Symbol timing circuits</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>The main drawback with using an <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
    data system to achieve symbol timing is the sacrifice in bandwidth that such a large <SPAN CLASS=greek>a
    </SPAN> entails. Also, when the received signal is accompanied by noise,
    individual zero-crossings may be corrupted by the noise and some form of averaging is
    desirable over many zero-crossings if accurate timing is to be achieved.</h4>

    <td width="50%"><h4>One circuit that can average the effects of noise as well as the
    non-perfect zero-crossings caused by smaller values of <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN> is
    the feedback timing control loop shown here. The circuit operates by using a
    mono-stable to create pulses of duration <i>T<sub>s</sub></i>/2 at each zero-crossing, which are
    then compared in a digital mixer with a locally generated clock running close to the
    symbol rate. The output of the mixer is integrated and filtered in order to produce a
    smoothed dc control voltage that is used to nudge the clock on to the correct symbol rate.
    The loop filtering process also serves to average out the noise accompanying the input
    signal and zero-crossing variations due to the small values of <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN>.</h4>
