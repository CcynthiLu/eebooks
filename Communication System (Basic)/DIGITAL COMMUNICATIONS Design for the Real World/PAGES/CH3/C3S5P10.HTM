<h2>Bit error rate vs symbol error rate </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>So far we have derived the probability of symbol error for a data
    system whereas in practice the user is more concerned with the probability of bit error
    for the communications link.<br>
    <br>
    For a binary system, bit and symbol error are identical as each symbol error corresponds
    to a single bit error. For M-ary systems (<i>M</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2), however, this does not hold true.
    For example, the <a href="../CH6/c6s2p1.htm">8-ary ASK</a> scheme shown here can convey
    three bits per symbol and may incur anything from one bit error to three bit errors for
    each incorrectly decoded symbol, depending on which symbol was mistakenly identified.</h4>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>In practice, some symbols are more likely to be detected in error
    than others, depending on how close or similar the symbols are to the correct symbol.
    Careful choice of bit pattern assignment to each symbol may thus help to minimize the
    number of bit errors occurring for every symbol error.</h4>
