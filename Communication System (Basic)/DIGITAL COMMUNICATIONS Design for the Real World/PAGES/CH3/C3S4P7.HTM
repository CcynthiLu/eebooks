    between message data transmissions. Most symbol timing systems, however, obtain their
    information from the message data itself, making use of the 'zero-crossing' information in
    the baseband (<a "" href="../Ch1/C1s4p7.htm">bipolar</a>) signal.<br>

    <td width="100%"><h4>The problem of symbol timing is eased significantly for <a HREF="C3s4p1.htm" "">raised cosine filtered</a> signals if the roll-off factor <SPAN CLASS=greek>a</SPAN> is equal to 1. For this unique case, the zero-crossings of the
    filtered waveform always occur at a time <i>T<sub>s</sub></i>/2 before the <a "" href="C3s2p1.htm">optimum zero ISI</a> detection point. Triggering a timer from these
    zero-crossings to sample the signal <I>T<sub>s</sub></i>/2 seconds later will thus give perfect
    symbol timing. When the data contains long strings of 1s or 0s, the sampling process must
    interpolate the correct sample times until the next zero-crossing occurs. Data
    'scrambling' can be used to try to increase the frequency of zero-crossings in the data
    stream. </h4>
