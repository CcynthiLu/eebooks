<h1>3.3 Eye Diagrams </h1>

<h2>Generation of eye diagrams</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4> The <font color="#0080FF">eye diagram</font> is a convenient visual
    method of diagnosing problems with data systems. <br>
    <br>
    An eye diagram is generated conventionally using an oscilloscope connected to the
    demodulated, filtered symbol stream, <font color="#0080FF">prior to</font> conversion of
    the symbols to binary digits. The oscilloscope is re-triggered at every symbol period or
    fixed multiple of symbol periods using a <a "" href="C3s4p7.htm">symbol timing signal</a>
    derived from the received waveform. By relying on the persistence of a typical
    oscilloscope display, the result is an overlaying of consecutive received symbol samples
    which form an <font color="#0080FF">&#145;eye&#146;</font> pattern on the screen. (This
    effect is re-created using modern digital storage scopes or computer displays in test
    equipment.) <br>
