<h2>The concept of an optimum (matched) filter </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="55%"><h4>It is prudent to ask the question: 'What type of averaging filter will
    give the best <i>S</i>/<i>N</i> ratio at the sampling point?' The answer is that it depends
    entirely on the symbol shape being used.<br>
    <br>
    Consider the two symbol shapes shown here, one a square (unshaped pulse) and the
    other a rounded pulse. For the square pulse, the <i>S</i>/<i>N</i> ratio at each point in the
    symbol is approximately constant, and an averaging process that gives equal weight to each
    point would be optimum. This in fact is exactly what an <a "" href="C3s5p2.htm">integrate
    and dump filter</a> does. For the rounded pulse, however, it is evident that the <i>S</i>/<i>N</i>
    ratio is greater in the centre of the pulse than at the edges, and it would thus make
    sense to give more weight to averaging the central region rather than the edges of the
    symbol. Hence the integrate and dump filter would not be optimum for this shape of symbol.
    </h4>
    <h4>A detection filter that does optimize the <i>S</i>/<i>N</i> ratio for a symbol is called a <font color="#0080FF">matched filter</font> because its averaging effect is matched to the pulse
    shape. The integrate and dump filter is thus a matched filter for a rectangular pulse
    shape, but would not be matched to a root raised cosine pulse, for example. </h4>
