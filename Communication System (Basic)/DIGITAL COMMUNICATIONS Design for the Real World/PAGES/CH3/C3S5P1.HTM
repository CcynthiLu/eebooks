    data signal and filtering for minimum <a "" href="C3s2p1.htm">intersymbol interference</a>
    we shall now turn our attention to the question of how to optimize the detection of data
    symbols in the presence of noise. This discussion will be limited to the case of <a "" href="../CH4/c4s3p6.htm">Additive White Gaussian Noise</a> which simplifies the
    mathematical treatment considerably. For many applications, this fortunately represents a
    good approximation to reality.</h4>
