    be 'matched' to the input symbol pulse shape if the filter is designed with an impulse
    response that is in fact a time reversed and delayed replica of the input symbol shape.
    Alternatively, the frequency domain response of a matched filter must be equal to the
    complex conjugate of the spectrum of the input symbol.</h4>

    <td width="100%"><h4>If we can assume that the channel is distortion free or has been <a "" href="../CH4/c4s5p9.htm">equalized</a> to remove the distortion, then we can introduce
    the concept of a <font color="#0080FF">matched filter pair</font>, with one filter
    performing the pulse shaping in the transmitter and the other performing matched detection
    in the receiver. We already have a requirement for paired filtering, however, driven by
    the desire to achieve zero intersymbol interference. The important question is: does the <a "" href="C3s2p1.htm">Nyquist filtering requirement for zero ISI</a> conflict with the
    matched filtering requirement for optimum <em>S/N</em> ratio? Fortunately it has been
    proven mathematically (<a href="../CH10/c10s1p1.htm#Schwartz">Schwartz, 1990</a>) that the <a "" href="c3s4p1.htm">root raised cosine filter</a> pair satisfies both criteria, which
    explains its popularity with modem designers around the world. </h4>
