<h1>3.2 Intersymbol interference (ISI)</h1>

<h2>The problem of intersymbol interference</h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>With any practical channel, the inevitable filtering effect will cause
    a spreading (smearing) of individual data symbols passing through the channel. For
    consecutive symbols, this spreading causes part of the symbol energy to overlap with
    neighbouring symbols, causing <font color="#0080FF">intersymbol interference (ISI).</font>
    Additionally, filtering in the transmitter or receiver units themselves may also introduce
    ISI degradation. <br>

    ability of the data detector to differentiate a current symbol from diffused energy of
    adjacent symbols. Even with no noise present in the channel this can lead to detection
    errors, termed an <font color="#0080FF">irreducible error rate</font>, and at the very
    least will degrade the bit and symbol error rate performance in the presence of noise. </h4>
