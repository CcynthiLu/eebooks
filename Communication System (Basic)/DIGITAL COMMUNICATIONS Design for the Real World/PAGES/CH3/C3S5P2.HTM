<h2>Recovery of symbols from noise (cont) </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>The chances of the receiver making the correct decision are of course
    greatly improved if the detector incorporates some form of 'averaging' (filtering) in
    order to improve the signal to noise ratio at a particular sampling point.<br>
    <br>
    For example, passing the symbol through an integrator would gradually improve the <i>S</i>/<i>N</i>
    ratio, reaching a maximum at the end of the symbol period. If the integrator continued to
    average over the following symbol (in this case a zero), the output would begin to fall
    and would yield a non-optimum result for both the 1 and 0 symbols. For this reason it
    would be prudent to reset the integrator at the beginning of each new symbol. This type of
    detector is commonly described as an <font color="#0080FF">integrate and dump</font>
    filter. </h4>
