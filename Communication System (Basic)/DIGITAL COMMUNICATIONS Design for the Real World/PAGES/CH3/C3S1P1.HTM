    voltage pulses representing 0s and 1s being passed over a piece of cable or perhaps a
    radio system. In actual fact, this is rarely how digital information is sent.</h4>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>In <a href="C3S2P1.HTM">section 3.2</a>, the filtering effects of a
    channel are analysed for their impact on streams of data pulses &#150;  bits and symbols. What
    at first sight appears to be a 'show stopper' for data transmission &#150;  the intersymbol
    interference caused by channel filtering &#150;  is shown to be unfounded if steps are taken to
    achieve a Nyquist filter response for the whole system. <a href="C3S3P1.HTM">Section 3.3</a>
    introduces the eye diagram as a powerful visual tool for observing and diagnosing problems
    within the modem portion of a digital communications link. This is followed in <a href="C3S4P1.HTM">Section 3.4</a> by a look at a very popular type of channel filter, the
    raised cosine filter, which is found in almost all modern modem implementations. <a href="C3S5P1.HTM">Section 3.5</a> discusses the concept of a matched filter &#150; this in
    fact describes an overall channel filter response that should result in the optimum
    performance of the modem in the presence of noise. Finally, <a href="C3S6P1.HTM">Section
    3.6</a> goes against the stance taken in Section 3.3 by advocating the introduction of a
    controlled amount of intersymbol interference into the system by careful choice of filter
    (termed partial response signalling). Surprisingly, perhaps, this can achieve improved
    performance under certain conditions. </h4>
