<h2>Bit error rate (BER) performance for baseband data systems </h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h4>In order to determine the likelihood of a data detector decoding
    symbols correctly in the presence of noise, we have to operate with probabilities and
    statistics. Noise is <font color="#0080FF">non-deterministic</font>, that is, its
    amplitude and phase vary randomly with time so that during some symbols the instantaneous
    levels of noise will be greater than for others. We thus must resign ourselves to working
    out the <font color="#0080FF">probability</font> of decoding symbols in error, rather than
    the certainty of decoding symbols in error.</h4>

    rather than symbol error as this directly impinges on the integrity of data sent to the
