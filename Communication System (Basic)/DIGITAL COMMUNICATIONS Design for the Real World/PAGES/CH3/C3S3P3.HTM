    states and 16 states in the demodulated signal. This would be typical for one branch of a
    16-QAM (<a href="../Ch6/C6s5p1.htm">Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</a>) and 256-QAM
    modem. The eye diagram as a diagnosis tool comes into its own here, showing clearly the
    individual 'eyes' between the discrete states, and also illustrating how critical the
    sample timing must be to detect the symbol at the maximum eye opening.<br>

    <td width="100%"><h4>It also serves to show how much more susceptible higher-order
    modulation formats are to noise and distortion when compared with a binary system of
    equivalent energy per bit. The eye opening for the four-level system is so much narrower
    and the spacing between decision boundaries so much smaller than those in the previous
    two-state examples and this gets progressively worse as the number of symbol states rises.
    Great care should be exercised when using the <a href="C3s3p1.htm">eye diagram for
    diagnosis</a> to ensure that the observation is made after all the filtering within the
    system. </h4>
