    communications channel will inherently exhibit a Nyquist transfer response. This means

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4>A telephone line modem presents a significant challenge for a zero
    ISI design as the <a href="../Ch4/c4s4p1.htm">transmission channel</a> itself may well
    introduce significant filter distortion which will compromise any carefully engineered
    Nyquist response between the sending and receiving hardware. In this scenario, it is
    necessary to try to correct for the channel distortion, or reconfigure the TX/RX filters
    so that the overall response is Nyquist. </h4>
    <h4>Usually, <a href="../Ch4/c4s5p9.htm">adaptive channel equalizers</a> are employed
    which attempt to flatten the channel transfer function so that the symbol shaping in the
    sending and receiving units predominates. For zero ISI performance, it is necessary to
    make sure that the <font color="#0080FF">overall transfer function of these compound filters
    is Nyquist</font>. Most modern telephone modems operating at speeds above 4.8 kbps employ
    adaptive equalization using a 'training sequence' in the handshaking at the start of each
    call to measure the non-ideal channel response.<br>
