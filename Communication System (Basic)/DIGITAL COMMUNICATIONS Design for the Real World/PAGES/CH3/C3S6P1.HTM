<h1>3.6 Partial response signalling </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><h4><font color="#0080FF">Partial response signalling</font>, or <font
    color="#0080FF">correlative coding</font> as it is sometimes called, is a baseband
    signalling technique that <font color="#0080FF">deliberately</font> introduces large
    amounts of intersymbol interference into the transmitted signal in order to ease the
    burden on the pulse-shaping filters.<br>
    <br>
    The reasoning is that if intersymbol interference is added in a simple and controlled
    manner, then it should be possible to subtract out the interference in the receiver.
    Removing the need to strive for <a "" href="c3s2p2.htm">Nyquist filter</a> operation with
    minimum bandwidth, high roll-off filters is the motivation behind the partial response
    technique.<br>
    <br>
    A whole family of partial response signalling methods exists however, by way of
    introduction, we will discuss only two very simple and well-known forms &#150; <font
    color="#0080FF">duo-binary</font> and <font color="#0080FF">modified duo-binary</font>
    signalling. </h4>
