<H1>How to use the combined book and CD </H1>
<P>
Both the printed book and electronic book contain the same fundamental content on a page-by-page basis. They can therefore be used independently and interchangeably, according to the preferred learning style of the student, teaching style of the department, or method of easiest reference for the professional.

<H2>Differences between the printed book and the CD</H2>
<P>
 You may read the printed book without reference to the CD as the book contains all the fundamental information you need to learn about digital communications. The CD contains the same content as the book in browsable electronic form along with these additional features to enhance the learning experience:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>animated figures to aid understanding
	<LI>linked cross-references for ease of exploration
	<LI>hyperlinks to further information on the World Wide Web
	<LI>MATLAB code, ready to run simulations
	<LI>answers to problems from the printed text.
</UL>
<P>
 In the book, icons indicate where the animations, weblinks and MATLAB code feature on the CD. 

<H2>Systems requirements</H2>
<P>
The software on the CD is in 16-bit form and is designed for use with PC/Windows (3.1, '95, NT) and Macintosh machines with at least 8Mb RAM. It has been optimized for use on Pentium PCs or PowerMACs.
<P>
Hyperlinks from the product to related material on the World Wide Web will only function if you have an active Internet connection already set up. 
<P>
The product supports its own bookmarking function using the browser's internal Cookie software. If you usually disable Cookies in your browser you will be unable to bookmark pages of the electronic book.
<P>
The viewing window has been designed for optimum layout of the text and graphics without need for scrolling. However, at screen resolutions below the common SuperVGA (800 x 600) you may have to scroll to access all the information on the screen.
<P>
The electronic book is designed to be viewed using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later. Some features may not operate in other browsers.

<H2>Installing and starting the electronic book</H2>
<P>
These electronic book files are designed to be viewed using the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser version 4.0 or later. To install the browser on your machine, follow the instructions given in the README on the CD.<P>
 To start the ‘book’ after installing the browser:
<P>
1. Start Internet Explorer 4
<BR>
2. (PC) Choose <B>File</B> from the Menubar and <B>Open</B> from the File menu. Click on the <B>Browse</B> button to obtain a file listing.
<BR>
2. (MAC) Choose <B>File</B> from the Menubar and <B>Open file ... </B>  from the File menu. 
<BR>
3. Choose the drive and directory/folder containing the the product (eg CD drive or network drive if the product is networked), and open the file <B>start.htm</B>. This launches the opening screen. You may want to add this page to your browser’s 'favourites' so that you can locate it quickly next time.
<BR>
4. Click on the <B>Start</B> button. The main window for the electronic book will appear. If not all of the window is visible, reposition the window and/or see the notes under systems requirements.

<H2>Navigating around the electronic book</H2>

<H3>Buttons on the left-hand side of the screen</H3>
<P>
You can navigate to any part of the book by using the buttons appearing down the left-hand side of the screen.

		<DD>is used to highlight important terms and concepts.
		<P>
	<DT><font color="#0000cc"><U>Blue underlined text</U></font>
		<DD>indicates a cross-reference to further information within the book. Clicking on the link takes you to the topic, so for example you can follow a link to learn about a new, related topic or to refresh your memory about an old one. This linked approach encourages flexible learning styles and allows the book to be layered, with more in-depth information, or more detailed explanation/revision, only offered to you if requested or required.
		<P>
	<DT><A CLASS="external" HREF="">Red underlined text</A>
		<DD>indicates a hypertext link to related information on the World Wide Web. Clicking on the link opens a new window containing the relevant page. These links will only function if you have an active Internet connection already set up.

	<DT><TABLE CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="0"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#99ccff">Blue panel</TD><TR></TABLE>
		<DD>is used to indicate definitions of key concepts.

<P>
Many pages are accompanied by further material in the form of in-depth sections, worked examples, questions and MATLAB code. Where there is further material associated with a main page, relevant buttons appear in the top-right corner of the main page. Clicking on the button will open a new window which contains the requested information and can be viewed simultaneously with the main book screen. This linked approach encourages flexible learning styles and allows the book to be layered, with more in-depth information, or more detailed explanation/revision, only offered to you if requested or required.
