<h1>Preface</H1>

<h2>Who is this book for?</h2>
<P>
This book provides a framework for understanding and evaluating the key design topics and choices involved in developing a data communications link.
<P>
It has been devised specifically to serve as a <FONT color="0080ff">first stage text</font> for undergraduate students (probably in their second year of study), such that they are fully equipped to study the more theoretical, statistical aspects of digital communications in later years, and will do so fully conversant with the context in which this analysis and rigour will be applied.
<P>
By bringing to the fore the design choices facing communications engineers, within an intuitive framework, the book also fulfils the role of a <FONT color="0080ff">Getting Started</font> plus <FONT color="0080ff">Frequently Asked Questions</font> manual in digital communications for practising engineers and managers. It will allow them to home in rapidly on the design parameters that are pertinent to their particular application and specification, and so better focus engineering resource within their organizations.

<h2>What previous knowledge is required?</h2>
<P>
Readers of the book are expected to have a basic understanding of the frequency content of simple waveforms (Fourier Series expansions) and hence appreciate the concepts of bandwidth, filtering and so on.
<P>
In addition, the mathematics of integration, differentiation and trigonometry are assumed, but not relied on for understanding of the text. For those who are a bit rusty in these areas, a short review of Fourier series and relevant trigonometrical relationships is included in Chapter 1.
<P>
All other material is developed from an intuitive or first principles approach.

<h2>How does the material in this book differ from other digital communications texts?</h2>
<P>
Most, if not all, competing student texts aim to cover the full subject matter over all years of a degree programme. As a consequence, the subject matter is predominately driven from a mathematical description of modulation type and performance, in contrast to the application and intuitive approach of this text.
<P>
The subject material in this book is a carefully selected range of topics that give the reader a structured overview of the digital communications arena, with emphasis on modem design, performance trade-offs, key limiting factors, and practical issues in implementation over real-world channels.
<P>
The book provides a <FONT color="0080ff">layered framework</font> in which the reader can quickly identify those design aspects relevant to his or her application and then follow the hyperlinks, or reference list provided, in order to obtain more specific information. 

<h2>Where has the material originated?</h2>
<P>
The material within the book has been developed and refined over ten years of lecturing on digital communications to second and third year undergraduates and Masters level students 
at Bristol University in England, in a series of focused courses to engineers and managers run by Oxford University, and on site with companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Philips. 
<P>
Experience has repeatedly shown that practising engineers who have pursued an undergraduate or post-graduate communications course in the past welcome the applications-driven and context-driven structure of this book, serving as both a reminder of the key design issues and a pooling of the basic design information and criteria from which to structure a more detailed research or design programme.

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<P>
Andy Bateman was formerly a Professor of Communications and Signal Processing at the University of Bristol, England. Aged 39, he has been involved in the research and design of digital communications systems for the past 16 years, working with companies such as Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, AT&amp;T and Hewlett-Packard to develop state-of-the-art data communications equipment. In 1995 he co-founded a company &#150; <a CLASS="external" TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.wsil.com">Wireless Systems International Ltd</a> &#150; which specializes in providing equipment and design/consultancy in all aspects of wireless digital communications, with clients ranging from small and large telecommunications manufacturers to operators and end users. He can be contacted on email at: <A CLASS="external" HREF="mailto:ab@wsi.co.uk">ab@wsi.co.uk</a>
<P>
As a regular invited lecturer on the subject of digital communications design around the world, and with the challenging task of introducing second year undergraduates at Bristol to the vast topic of modern communications, he has developed a very intuitive means of presenting the often complex material so that the principles are easily grasped. This style makes the book very readable as both an excellent basic reference and introductory student text.
<P>
He is also author of the book Digital Signal Processing Design (Bateman and Yates (1989)) which is a practical guide to DSP algorithms and applications.
