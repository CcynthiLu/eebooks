REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ELECTRONIC PRODUCT
=====================================================
The software is in 16 bit form and is designed for use with 
PC/Windows (3.1, '95, NT) and Macintosh machines with at least 
8mb RAM.

It has been optimised for use on Pentium PCs or PowerMACs.

The viewing window has been designed for optimum layout of the 
text and graphics without need for scrolling. However, at 
screen resolutions below the common SuperVGA (800 x 600) you 
may have to scroll to access all the information on the screen.

Hyperlinks from the product to related material on the World 
Wide Web will only function if you have an active Internet 
connection already set up. 

The product supports its own bookmarking function using the 
browser's Cookie software. If you usually disable Cookies in 
your browser you will be unable to bookmark pages of the 
electronic book. Bookmarks are saved from one session to
another on Macintosh and Windows '95 platforms.

These files are designed to be viewed using Microsoft Internet 
Explorer version 4.0 or later. Some features may not operate 
in other browsers. 

INSTALLING MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0 (PC Windows platforms)
=================================================================

Before running the electronic book, install Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 4.0 on your machine if you do not already have it. 
This CD comes with Microsoft's installer wizard for Explorer 4.0 
for PC Windows 3.1 and 95/NT platforms. To install Explorer 4.0 
using the installer wizard:

1. Use File Manager (3.1) or Windows Explorer (95/NT) to 
locate the program IESETUP.EXE on the CD. Double-click 
IESETUP.EXE to start the browser installer wizard.

2. Follow the wizard's on-screen prompts to install the 
browser. NB (Windows 95/NT users only): For Windows 95/NT 
users, the installer wizard will give you the option to 
install the 'Active Desktop' component of Internet Explorer. 
This will change the way your desktop functions so 
that local files and internet-based files are treated in a 
more similar manner. For the cleanest installation with least 
change to your machine's configuration, we recommend you 
answer 'NO' to the option to update to the 'Active Desktop'.

3. The browser installer wizard will reboot your machine when 
installation is completed.

4. When your machine has rebooted, follow the instructions 
'Starting the Electronic Book' later in this README.
